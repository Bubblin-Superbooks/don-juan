You're a poet, poet laureate,\n  And representative of all the race.\nAlthough 'tis true that you turned out a Tory at\n  Last, yours has lately been a common case.\nAnd now my epic renegade, what are ye at\n  With all the lakers, in and out of place?\nA nest of tuneful persons, to my eye\nLike four and twenty blackbirds in a pye,\n\nWhich pye being opened they began to sing'\n  (This old song and new simile holds good),\n'A dainty dish to set before the King'\n  Or Regent, who admires such kind of food.\nAnd Coleridge too has lately taken wing,\n  But like a hawk encumbered with his hood,\nExplaining metaphysics to the nation.\nI wish he would explain his explanation.\n\nYou, Bob, are rather insolent, you know,\n  At being disappointed in your wish\nTo supersede all warblers here below,\n  And be the only blackbird in the dish.\nAnd then you overstrain yourself, or so,\n  And tumble downward like the flying fish\nGasping on deck, because you soar too high,\nBob, And fall for lack of moisture quite a dry Bob.\n\nAnd Wordsworth in a rather long Excursion\n  (I think the quarto holds five hundred pages)\nHas given a sample from the vasty version\n  Of his new system to perplex the sages.\n'Tis poetry, at least by his assertion,\n  And may appear so when the Dog Star rages,\nAnd he who understands it would be able\nTo add a story to the tower of Babel.\n\nYou gentlemen, by dint of long seclusion\n  From better company, have kept your own\nAt Keswick, and through still continued fusion\n  Of one another's minds at last have grown\nTo deem, as a most logical conclusion,\n  That poesy has wreaths for you alone.\nThere is a narrowness in such a notion,\nWhich makes me wish you'd change your lakes for ocean.\n\nI would not imitate the petty thought,\n  Nor coin my self-love to so base a vice,\nFor all the glory your conversion brought,\n  Since gold alone should not have been its price.\nYou have your salary; was't for that you wrought?\n  And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.\nYou're shabby fellows—true—but poets still\nAnd duly seated on the immortal hill.\n\nYour bays may hide the baldness of your brows,\n  Perhaps some virtuous blushes; let them go.\nTo you I envy neither fruit nor boughs,\n  And for the fame you would engross below,\nThe field is universal and allows\n  Scope to all such as feel the inherent glow.\nScott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe will try\n'Gainst you the question with posterity.\n\nFor me, who, wandering with pedestrian Muses,\n  Contend not with you on the winged' steed,\nI wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,\n  The fame you envy and the skill you need.\nAnd recollect a poet nothing loses\n  In giving to his brethren their full meed\nOf merit, and complaint of present days\nIs not the certain path to future praise.\n\nHe that reserves his laurels for posterity\n  (Who does not often claim the bright reversion)\nHas generally no great crop to spare it, he\n  Being only injured by his own assertion.\nAnd although here and there some glorious rarity\n  Arise like Titan from the sea's immersion,\nThe major part of such appellants go\nTo—God knows where—for no one else can know.\n\nIf fallen in evil days on evil tongues,\n  Milton appealed to the avenger, Time,\nIf Time, the avenger, execrates his wrongs\n  And makes the word Miltonic mean sublime,\nHe deigned not to belie his soul in songs,\n  Nor turn his very talent to a crime.\nHe did not loathe the sire to laud the son,\nBut closed the tyrant-hater he begun.\n\nThink'st thou, could he, the blind old man, arise\n  Like Samuel from the grave to freeze once more\nThe blood of monarchs with his prophecies,\n   Or be alive again—again all hoar\nWith time and trials, and those helpless eyes\n  And heartless daughters—worn and pale and poor,\nWould he adore a sultan? He obey\nThe intellectual eunuch Castlereagh?\n\nCold-blooded, smooth-faced, placid miscreant!\n  Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin's gore,\nAnd thus for wider carnage taught to pant,\n  Transferred to gorge upon a sister shore,\nThe vulgarest tool that tyranny could want,\n  With just enough of talent and no more,\nTo lengthen fetters by another fixed\nAnd offer poison long already mixed.\n\nAn orator of such set trash of phrase,\n  Ineffably, legitimately vile,\nThat even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,\n  Nor foes—all nations—condescend to smile.\nNot even a sprightly blunder's spark can blaze\n  From that Ixion grindstone's ceaseless toil,\nThat turns and turns to give the world a notion\nOf endless torments and perpetual motion.\n\nA bungler even in its disgusting trade,\n  And botching, patching, leaving still behind\nSomething of which its masters are afraid,\n  States to be curbed and thoughts to be confined,\nConspiracy or congress to be made,\n  Cobbling at manacles for all mankind,\nA tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,\nWith God and man's abhorrence for its gains.\n\nIf we may judge of matter by the mind,\nEmasculated to the marrow, it\nHath but two objects, how to serve and bind,\nDeeming the chain it wears even men may fit,\nEutropius of its many masters, blind\nTo worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,\nFearless, because no feeling dwells in ice;\nIts very courage stagnates to a vice.\n\nWhere shall I turn me not to view its bonds,\n  For I will never feel them. Italy,\nThy late reviving Roman soul desponds\n  Beneath the lie this state-thing breathed o'er thee.\nThy clanking chain and Erin's yet green wounds\n  Have voices, tongues to cry aloud for me.\nEurope has slaves, allies, kings, armies still,\nAnd Southey lives to sing them very ill.\n\nMeantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate\n  In honest simple verse this song to you.\nAnd if in flattering strains I do not predicate,\n  'Tis that I still retain my buff and blue;\nMy politics as yet are all to educate.\n  Apostasy's so fashionable too,\nTo keep one creed's a task grown quite\nHerculean Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?</code>"

    "innerHtml": "<code>I want a hero: an uncommon want,\n  When every year and month sends forth a new one,\nTill, after cloying the gazettes with cant,\n  The age discovers he is not the true one;\nOf such as these I should not care to vaunt,\n  I 'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan—\nWe all have seen him, in the pantomime,\nSent to the devil somewhat ere his time.\n\nVernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,\n  Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,\nEvil and good, have had their tithe of talk,\n  And fill'd their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;\nEach in their turn like Banquo's monarchs stalk,\n  Followers of fame, 'nine farrow' of that sow:\nFrance, too, had Buonaparte and Dumourier\nRecorded in the Moniteur and Courier.\n\nBarnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,\n  Petion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette,\nWere French, and famous people, as we know:\n  And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,\nJoubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,\n  With many of the military set,\nExceedingly remarkable at times,\nBut not at all adapted to my rhymes.\n\nNelson was once Britannia's god of war,\n  And still should be so, but the tide is turn'd;\nThere 's no more to be said of Trafalgar,\n  'T is with our hero quietly inurn'd;\nBecause the army 's grown more popular,\n  At which the naval people are concern'd;\nBesides, the prince is all for the land-service,\nForgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.\n\nBrave men were living before Agamemnon\n  And since, exceeding valorous and sage,\nA good deal like him too, though quite the same none;\n  But then they shone not on the poet's page,\nAnd so have been forgotten:—I condemn none,\n  But can't find any in the present age\nFit for my poem (that is, for my new one);\nSo, as I said, I 'll take my friend Don Juan.\n\nMost epic poets plunge 'in medias res'\n  (Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),\nAnd then your hero tells, whene'er you please,\n  What went before—by way of episode,\nWhile seated after dinner at his ease,\n  Beside his mistress in some soft abode,\nPalace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,\nWhich serves the happy couple for a tavern.\n\nThat is the usual method, but not mine—\n  My way is to begin with the beginning;\nThe regularity of my design\n  Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,\nAnd therefore I shall open with a line\n  (Although it cost me half an hour in spinning)\nNarrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,\nAnd also of his mother, if you 'd rather.\n\nIn Seville was he born, a pleasant city,\n  Famous for oranges and women—he\nWho has not seen it will be much to pity,\n  So says the proverb—and I quite agree;\nOf all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,\n  Cadiz perhaps—but that you soon may see;\nDon Juan's parents lived beside the river,\nA noble stream, and call'd the Guadalquivir.\n\nHis father's name was Jose—Don, of course,—\n  A true Hidalgo, free from every stain\nOf Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source\n  Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;\nA better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,\n  Or, being mounted, e'er got down again,\nThan Jose, who begot our hero, who\nBegot—but that 's to come—Well, to renew:\n\nHis mother was a learned lady, famed\n  For every branch of every science known\nIn every Christian language ever named,\n  With virtues equall'd by her wit alone,\nShe made the cleverest people quite ashamed,\n  And even the good with inward envy groan,\nFinding themselves so very much exceeded\nIn their own way by all the things that she did.\n\nHer memory was a mine: she knew by heart\n  All Calderon and greater part of Lope,\nSo that if any actor miss'd his part\n  She could have served him for the prompter's copy;\nFor her Feinagle's were an useless art,\n  And he himself obliged to shut up shop—he\nCould never make a memory so fine as\nThat which adorn'd the brain of Donna Inez.\n\nHer favourite science was the mathematical,\n  Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,\nHer wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,\n  Her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity;\nIn short, in all things she was fairly what I call\n  A prodigy—her morning dress was dimity,\nHer evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,\nAnd other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.\n\nShe knew the Latin—that is, 'the Lord's prayer,'\n  And Greek—the alphabet—I 'm nearly sure;\nShe read some French romances here and there,\n  Although her mode of speaking was not pure;\nFor native Spanish she had no great care,\n  At least her conversation was obscure;\nHer thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,\nAs if she deem'd that mystery would ennoble 'em.\n\nShe liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,\n  And said there was analogy between 'em;\nShe proved it somehow out of sacred song,\n  But I must leave the proofs to those who 've seen 'em;\nBut this I heard her say, and can't be wrong\n  And all may think which way their judgments lean 'em,\n''T is strange—the Hebrew noun which means \"I am,\"\nThe English always use to govern d—n.'\n\nSome women use their tongues—she look'd a lecture,\n  Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,\nAn all-in-all sufficient self-director,\n  Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,\nThe Law's expounder, and the State's corrector,\n  Whose suicide was almost an anomaly—\nOne sad example more, that 'All is vanity'\n(The jury brought their verdict in 'Insanity').\n\nIn short, she was a walking calculation,\n  Miss Edgeworth's novels stepping from their covers,\nOr Mrs. Trimmer's books on education,\n  Or 'Coelebs' Wife' set out in quest of lovers,\nMorality's prim personification,\n  In which not Envy's self a flaw discovers;\nTo others' share let 'female errors fall,'\nFor she had not even one—the worst of all.\n\nO! she was perfect past all parallel—\n  Of any modern female saint's comparison;\nSo far above the cunning powers of hell,\n  Her guardian angel had given up his garrison;\nEven her minutest motions went as well\n  As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:\nIn virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,\nSave thine 'incomparable oil,' Macassar!\n\nPerfect she was, but as perfection is\n  Insipid in this naughty world of ours,\nWhere our first parents never learn'd to kiss\n  Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,\nWhere all was peace, and innocence, and bliss\n  (I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),\nDon Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,\nWent plucking various fruit without her leave.\n\nHe was a mortal of the careless kind,\n  With no great love for learning, or the learn'd,\nWho chose to go where'er he had a mind,\n  And never dream'd his lady was concern'd;\nThe world, as usual, wickedly inclined\n  To see a kingdom or a house o'erturn'd,\nWhisper'd he had a mistress, some said two—\nBut for domestic quarrels one will do.\n\nNow Donna Inez had, with all her merit,\n  A great opinion of her own good qualities;\nNeglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,\n  And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;\nBut then she had a devil of a spirit,\n  And sometimes mix'd up fancies with realities,\nAnd let few opportunities escape\nOf getting her liege lord into a scrape.\n\nThis was an easy matter with a man\n  Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;\nAnd even the wisest, do the best they can,\n  Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,\nThat you might 'brain them with their lady's fan;'\n  And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,\nAnd fans turn into falchions in fair hands,\nAnd why and wherefore no one understands.\n\n'T is pity learned virgins ever wed\n  With persons of no sort of education,\nOr gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,\n  Grow tired of scientific conversation:\nI don't choose to say much upon this head,\n  I 'm a plain man, and in a single station,\nBut—Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,\nInform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all?\n\nDon Jose and his lady quarrell'd—why,\n  Not any of the many could divine,\nThough several thousand people chose to try,\n  'T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;\nI loathe that low vice—curiosity;\n  But if there 's anything in which I shine,\n'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,\nNot having of my own domestic cares.\n\nAnd so I interfered, and with the best\n  Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;\nI think the foolish people were possess'd,\n  For neither of them could I ever find,\nAlthough their porter afterwards confess'd—\n  But that 's no matter, and the worst 's behind,\nFor little Juan o'er me threw, down stairs,\nA pail of housemaid's water unawares.\n\nA little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,\n  And mischief-making monkey from his birth;\nHis parents ne'er agreed except in doting\n  Upon the most unquiet imp on earth;\nInstead of quarrelling, had they been but both in\n  Their senses, they 'd have sent young master forth\nTo school, or had him soundly whipp'd at home,\nTo teach him manners for the time to come.\n\nDon Jose and the Donna Inez led\n  For some time an unhappy sort of life,\nWishing each other, not divorced, but dead;\n  They lived respectably as man and wife,\nTheir conduct was exceedingly well-bred,\n  And gave no outward signs of inward strife,\nUntil at length the smother'd fire broke out,\nAnd put the business past all kind of doubt.\n\nFor Inez call'd some druggists and physicians,\n  And tried to prove her loving lord was mad;\nBut as he had some lucid intermissions,\n  She next decided he was only bad;\nYet when they ask'd her for her depositions,\n  No sort of explanation could be had,\nSave that her duty both to man and God\nRequired this conduct—which seem'd very odd.\n\nShe kept a journal, where his faults were noted,\n  And open'd certain trunks of books and letters,\nAll which might, if occasion served, be quoted;\n  And then she had all Seville for abettors,\nBesides her good old grandmother (who doted);\n  The hearers of her case became repeaters,\nThen advocates, inquisitors, and judges,\nSome for amusement, others for old grudges.\n\nAnd then this best and weakest woman bore\n  With such serenity her husband's woes,\nJust as the Spartan ladies did of yore,\n  Who saw their spouses kill'd, and nobly chose\nNever to say a word about them more—\n  Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,\nAnd saw his agonies with such sublimity,\nThat all the world exclaim'd, 'What magnanimity!'\n\nNo doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,\n  Is philosophic in our former friends;\n'T is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous,\n  The more so in obtaining our own ends;\nAnd what the lawyers call a 'malus animus'\n  Conduct like this by no means comprehends;\nRevenge in person 's certainly no virtue,\nBut then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you.\n\nAnd if your quarrels should rip up old stories,\n  And help them with a lie or two additional,\nI 'm not to blame, as you well know—no more is\n  Any one else—they were become traditional;\nBesides, their resurrection aids our glories\n  By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:\nAnd science profits by this resurrection—\nDead scandals form good subjects for dissection.\n\nTheir friends had tried at reconciliation,\n  Then their relations, who made matters worse.\n('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion\n  To whom it may be best to have recourse—\nI can't say much for friend or yet relation):\n  The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,\nBut scarce a fee was paid on either side\nBefore, unluckily, Don Jose died.\n\nHe died: and most unluckily, because,\n  According to all hints I could collect\nFrom counsel learned in those kinds of laws\n  (Although their talk 's obscure and circumspect),\nHis death contrived to spoil a charming cause;\n  A thousand pities also with respect\nTo public feeling, which on this occasion\nWas manifested in a great sensation.\n\nBut, ah! he died; and buried with him lay\n  The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:\nHis house was sold, his servants sent away,\n  A Jew took one of his two mistresses,\nA priest the other—at least so they say:\n  I ask'd the doctors after his disease—\nHe died of the slow fever call'd the tertian,\nAnd left his widow to her own aversion.\n\nYet Jose was an honourable man,\n  That I must say who knew him very well;\nTherefore his frailties I 'll no further scan\n  Indeed there were not many more to tell;\nAnd if his passions now and then outran\n  Discretion, and were not so peaceable\nAs Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),\nHe had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.\n\nWhate'er might be his worthlessness or worth,\n  Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.\nLet 's own—since it can do no good on earth—\n  It was a trying moment that which found him\nStanding alone beside his desolate hearth,\n  Where all his household gods lay shiver'd round him:\nNo choice was left his feelings or his pride,\nSave death or Doctors' Commons—so he died.\n\nDying intestate, Juan was sole heir\n  To a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,\nWhich, with a long minority and care,\n  Promised to turn out well in proper hands:\nInez became sole guardian, which was fair,\n  And answer'd but to nature's just demands;\nAn only son left with an only mother\nIs brought up much more wisely than another.\n\nSagest of women, even of widows, she\n  Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,\nAnd worthy of the noblest pedigree\n  (His sire was of Castile, his dam from Aragon):\nThen for accomplishments of chivalry,\n  In case our lord the king should go to war again,\nHe learn'd the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,\nAnd how to scale a fortress—or a nunnery.\n\nBut that which Donna Inez most desired,\n  And saw into herself each day before all\nThe learned tutors whom for him she hired,\n  Was, that his breeding should be strictly moral;\nMuch into all his studies she inquired,\n  And so they were submitted first to her, all,\nArts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery\nTo Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.\n\nThe languages, especially the dead,\n  The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,\nThe arts, at least all such as could be said\n  To be the most remote from common use,\nIn all these he was much and deeply read;\n  But not a page of any thing that 's loose,\nOr hints continuation of the species,\nWas ever suffer'd, lest he should grow vicious.\n\nHis classic studies made a little puzzle,\n  Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,\nWho in the earlier ages raised a bustle,\n  But never put on pantaloons or bodices;\nHis reverend tutors had at times a tussle,\n  And for their AEneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,\nWere forced to make an odd sort! of apology,\nFor Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.\n\nOvid 's a rake, as half his verses show him,\n  Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,\nCatullus scarcely has a decent poem,\n  I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,\nAlthough Longinus tells us there is no hymn\n  Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:\nBut Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one\nBeginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon.'\n\nLucretius' irreligion is too strong,\n  For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;\nI can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,\n  Although no doubt his real intent was good,\nFor speaking out so plainly in his song,\n  So much indeed as to be downright rude;\nAnd then what proper person can be partial\nTo all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?\n\nJuan was taught from out the best edition,\n  Expurgated by learned men, who place\nJudiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,\n  The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface\nToo much their modest bard by this omission,\n  And pitying sore his mutilated case,\nThey only add them all in an appendix,\nWhich saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;\n\nFor there we have them all 'at one fell swoop,'\n  Instead of being scatter'd through the Pages;\nThey stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop,\n  To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,\nTill some less rigid editor shall stoop\n  To call them back into their separate cages,\nInstead of standing staring all together,\nLike garden gods—and not so decent either.\n\nThe Missal too (it was the family Missal)\n  Was ornamented in a sort of way\nWhich ancient mass-books often are, and this all\n  Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,\nWho saw those figures on the margin kiss all,\n  Could turn their optics to the text and pray,\nIs more than I know—But Don Juan's mother\nKept this herself, and gave her son another.\n\nSermons he read, and lectures he endured,\n  And homilies, and lives of all the saints;\nTo Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,\n  He did not take such studies for restraints;\nBut how faith is acquired, and then ensured,\n  So well not one of the aforesaid paints\nAs Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,\nWhich make the reader envy his transgressions.\n\nThis, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan—\n  I can't but say that his mamma was right,\nIf such an education was the true one.\n  She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;\nHer maids were old, and if she took a new one,\n  You might be sure she was a perfect fright;\nShe did this during even her husband's life—\nI recommend as much to every wife.\n\nYoung Juan wax'd in goodliness and grace;\n  At six a charming child, and at eleven\nWith all the promise of as fine a face\n  As e'er to man's maturer growth was given:\nHe studied steadily, and grew apace,\n  And seem'd, at least, in the right road to heaven,\nFor half his days were pass'd at church, the other\nBetween his tutors, confessor, and mother.\n\nAt six, I said, he was a charming child,\n  At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;\nAlthough in infancy a little wild,\n  They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy\nHis natural spirit not in vain they toil'd,\n  At least it seem'd so; and his mother's joy\nWas to declare how sage, and still, and steady,\nHer young philosopher was grown already.\n\nI had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,\n  But what I say is neither here nor there:\nI knew his father well, and have some skill\n  In character—but it would not be fair\nFrom sire to son to augur good or ill:\n  He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair—\nBut scandal 's my aversion—I protest\nAgainst all evil speaking, even in jest.\n\nFor my part I say nothing—nothing—but\n  This I will say—my reasons are my own—\nThat if I had an only son to put\n  To school (as God be praised that I have none),\n'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut\n  Him up to learn his catechism alone,\nNo—no—I 'd send him out betimes to college,\nFor there it was I pick'd up my own knowledge.\n\nFor there one learns—'t is not for me to boast,\n  Though I acquired—but I pass over that,\nAs well as all the Greek I since have lost:\n  I say that there 's the place—but 'Verbum sat.'\nI think I pick'd up too, as well as most,\n  Knowledge of matters—but no matter what—\nI never married—but, I think, I know\nThat sons should not be educated so.\n\nYoung Juan now was sixteen years of age,\n  Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem'd\nActive, though not so sprightly, as a page;\n  And everybody but his mother deem'd\nHim almost man; but she flew in a rage\n  And bit her lips (for else she might have scream'd)\nIf any said so, for to be precocious\nWas in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.\n\nAmongst her numerous acquaintance, all\n  Selected for discretion and devotion,\nThere was the Donna Julia, whom to call\n  Pretty were but to give a feeble notion\nOf many charms in her as natural\n  As sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,\nHer zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid\n(But this last simile is trite and stupid).\n\nThe darkness of her Oriental eye\n  Accorded with her Moorish origin\n(Her blood was not all Spanish, by the by;\n  In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin);\nWhen proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,\n  Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia's kin\nSome went to Africa, some stay'd in Spain,\nHer great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.\n\nShe married (I forget the pedigree)\n  With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down\nHis blood less noble than such blood should be;\n  At such alliances his sires would frown,\nIn that point so precise in each degree\n  That they bred in and in, as might be shown,\nMarrying their cousins—nay, their aunts, and nieces,\nWhich always spoils the breed, if it increases.\n\nThis heathenish cross restored the breed again,\n  Ruin'd its blood, but much improved its flesh;\nFor from a root the ugliest in Old Spain\n  Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;\nThe sons no more were short, the daughters plain:\n  But there 's a rumour which I fain would hush,\n'T is said that Donna Julia's grandmamma\nProduced her Don more heirs at love than law.\n\nHowever this might be, the race went on\n  Improving still through every generation,\nUntil it centred in an only son,\n  Who left an only daughter; my narration\nMay have suggested that this single one\n  Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion\nI shall have much to speak about), and she\nWas married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.\n\nHer eye (I 'm very fond of handsome eyes)\n  Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire\nUntil she spoke, then through its soft disguise\n  Flash'd an expression more of pride than ire,\nAnd love than either; and there would arise\n  A something in them which was not desire,\nBut would have been, perhaps, but for the soul\nWhich struggled through and chasten'd down the whole.\n\nHer glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow\n  Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;\nHer eyebrow's shape was like th' aerial bow,\n  Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,\nMounting at times to a transparent glow,\n  As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,\nPossess'd an air and grace by no means common:\nHer stature tall—I hate a dumpy woman.\n\nWedded she was some years, and to a man\n  Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;\nAnd yet, I think, instead of such a ONE\n  'T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,\nEspecially in countries near the sun:\n  And now I think on 't, 'mi vien in mente,'\nLadies even of the most uneasy virtue\nPrefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.\n\n'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,\n  And all the fault of that indecent sun,\nWho cannot leave alone our helpless clay,\n  But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,\nThat howsoever people fast and pray,\n  The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:\nWhat men call gallantry, and gods adultery,\nIs much more common where the climate 's sultry.\n\nHappy the nations of the moral North!\n  Where all is virtue, and the winter season\nSends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth\n  ('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);\nWhere juries cast up what a wife is worth,\n  By laying whate'er sum in mulct they please on\nThe lover, who must pay a handsome price,\nBecause it is a marketable vice.\n\nAlfonso was the name of Julia's lord,\n  A man well looking for his years, and who\nWas neither much beloved nor yet abhorr'd:\n  They lived together, as most people do,\nSuffering each other's foibles by accord,\n  And not exactly either one or two;\nYet he was jealous, though he did not show it,\nFor jealousy dislikes the world to know it.\n\nJulia was—yet I never could see why—\n  With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;\nBetween their tastes there was small sympathy,\n  For not a line had Julia ever penn'd:\nSome people whisper but no doubt they lie,\n  For malice still imputes some private end,\nThat Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,\nForgot with him her very prudent carriage;\n\nAnd that still keeping up the old connection,\n  Which time had lately render'd much more chaste,\nShe took his lady also in affection,\n  And certainly this course was much the best:\nShe flatter'd Julia with her sage protection,\n  And complimented Don Alfonso's taste;\nAnd if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,\nAt least she left it a more slender handle.\n\nI can't tell whether Julia saw the affair\n  With other people's eyes, or if her own\nDiscoveries made, but none could be aware\n  Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;\nPerhaps she did not know, or did not care,\n  Indifferent from the first or callous grown:\nI 'm really puzzled what to think or say,\nShe kept her counsel in so close a way.\n\nJuan she saw, and, as a pretty child,\n  Caress'd him often—such a thing might be\nQuite innocently done, and harmless styled,\n  When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;\nBut I am not so sure I should have smiled\n  When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;\nThese few short years make wondrous alterations,\nParticularly amongst sun-burnt nations.\n\nWhate'er the cause might be, they had become\n  Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,\nTheir looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,\n  And much embarrassment in either eye;\nThere surely will be little doubt with some\n  That Donna Julia knew the reason why,\nBut as for Juan, he had no more notion\nThan he who never saw the sea of ocean.\n\nYet Julia's very coldness still was kind,\n  And tremulously gentle her small hand\nWithdrew itself from his, but left behind\n  A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland\nAnd slight, so very slight, that to the mind\n  'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand\nWrought change with all Armida's fairy art\nLike what this light touch left on Juan's heart.\n\nAnd if she met him, though she smiled no more,\n  She look'd a sadness sweeter than her smile,\nAs if her heart had deeper thoughts in store\n  She must not own, but cherish'd more the while\nFor that compression in its burning core;\n  Even innocence itself has many a wile,\nAnd will not dare to trust itself with truth,\nAnd love is taught hypocrisy from youth.\n\nBut passion most dissembles, yet betrays\n  Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky\nForetells the heaviest tempest, it displays\n  Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,\nAnd in whatever aspect it arrays\n  Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;\nColdness or anger, even disdain or hate,\nAre masks it often wears, and still too late.\n\nThen there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,\n  And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,\nAnd burning blushes, though for no transgression,\n  Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;\nAll these are little preludes to possession,\n  Of which young passion cannot be bereft,\nAnd merely tend to show how greatly love is\nEmbarrass'd at first starting with a novice.\n\nPoor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;\n  She felt it going, and resolved to make\nThe noblest efforts for herself and mate,\n  For honour's, pride's, religion's, virtue's sake;\nHer resolutions were most truly great,\n  And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:\nShe pray'd the Virgin Mary for her grace,\nAs being the best judge of a lady's case.\n\nShe vow'd she never would see Juan more,\n  And next day paid a visit to his mother,\nAnd look'd extremely at the opening door,\n  Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;\nGrateful she was, and yet a little sore—\n  Again it opens, it can be no other,\n'T is surely Juan now—No! I 'm afraid\nThat night the Virgin was no further pray'd.\n\nShe now determined that a virtuous woman\n  Should rather face and overcome temptation,\nThat flight was base and dastardly, and no man\n  Should ever give her heart the least sensation;\nThat is to say, a thought beyond the common\n  Preference, that we must feel upon occasion\nFor people who are pleasanter than others,\nBut then they only seem so many brothers.\n\nAnd even if by chance—and who can tell?\n  The devil 's so very sly—she should discover\nThat all within was not so very well,\n  And, if still free, that such or such a lover\nMight please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell\n  Such thoughts, and be the better when they 're over;\nAnd if the man should ask, 't is but denial:\nI recommend young ladies to make trial.\n\nAnd then there are such things as love divine,\n  Bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure,\nSuch as the angels think so very fine,\n  And matrons who would be no less secure,\nPlatonic, perfect, 'just such love as mine;'\n  Thus Julia said—and thought so, to be sure;\nAnd so I 'd have her think, were I the man\nOn whom her reveries celestial ran.\n\nSuch love is innocent, and may exist\n  Between young persons without any danger.\nA hand may first, and then a lip be kist;\n  For my part, to such doings I 'm a stranger,\nBut hear these freedoms form the utmost list\n  Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:\nIf people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,\nBut not my fault—I tell them all in time.\n\nLove, then, but love within its proper limits,\n  Was Julia's innocent determination\nIn young Don Juan's favour, and to him its\n  Exertion might be useful on occasion;\nAnd, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its\n  Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion\nHe might be taught, by love and her together—\nI really don't know what, nor Julia either.\n\nFraught with this fine intention, and well fenced\n  In mail of proof—her purity of soul—\nShe, for the future of her strength convinced.\n  And that her honour was a rock, or mole,\nExceeding sagely from that hour dispensed\n  With any kind of troublesome control;\nBut whether Julia to the task was equal\nIs that which must be mention'd in the sequel.\n\nHer plan she deem'd both innocent and feasible,\n  And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen\nNot scandal's fangs could fix on much that 's seizable,\n  Or if they did so, satisfied to mean\nNothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable—\n  A quiet conscience makes one so serene!\nChristians have burnt each other, quite persuaded\nThat all the Apostles would have done as they did.\n\nAnd if in the mean time her husband died,\n  But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross\nHer brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh'd)\n  Never could she survive that common loss;\nBut just suppose that moment should betide,\n  I only say suppose it—inter nos.\n(This should be entre nous, for Julia thought\nIn French, but then the rhyme would go for naught.)\n\nI only say suppose this supposition:\n  Juan being then grown up to man's estate\nWould fully suit a widow of condition,\n  Even seven years hence it would not be too late;\nAnd in the interim (to pursue this vision)\n  The mischief, after all, could not be great,\nFor he would learn the rudiments of love,\nI mean the seraph way of those above.\n\nSo much for Julia. Now we 'll turn to Juan.\n  Poor little fellow! he had no idea\nOf his own case, and never hit the true one;\n  In feelings quick as Ovid's Miss Medea,\nHe puzzled over what he found a new one,\n  But not as yet imagined it could be\nThing quite in course, and not at all alarming,\nWhich, with a little patience, might grow charming.\n\nSilent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,\n  His home deserted for the lonely wood,\nTormented with a wound he could not know,\n  His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:\nI 'm fond myself of solitude or so,\n  But then, I beg it may be understood,\nBy solitude I mean a sultan's, not\nA hermit's, with a haram for a grot.\n\n'Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,\n  Where transport and security entwine,\nHere is the empire of thy perfect bliss,\n  And here thou art a god indeed divine.'\nThe bard I quote from does not sing amiss,\n  With the exception of the second line,\nFor that same twining 'transport and security'\nAre twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.\n\nThe poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals\n  To the good sense and senses of mankind,\nThe very thing which every body feels,\n  As all have found on trial, or may find,\nThat no one likes to be disturb'd at meals\n  Or love.—I won't say more about 'entwined'\nOr 'transport,' as we knew all that before,\nBut beg 'Security' will bolt the door.\n\nYoung Juan wander'd by the glassy brooks,\n  Thinking unutterable things; he threw\nHimself at length within the leafy nooks\n  Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;\nThere poets find materials for their books,\n  And every now and then we read them through,\nSo that their plan and prosody are eligible,\nUnless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.\n\nHe, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued\n  His self-communion with his own high soul,\nUntil his mighty heart, in its great mood,\n  Had mitigated part, though not the whole\nOf its disease; he did the best he could\n  With things not very subject to control,\nAnd turn'd, without perceiving his condition,\nLike Coleridge, into a metaphysician.\n\nHe thought about himself, and the whole earth\n  Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,\nAnd how the deuce they ever could have birth;\n  And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,\nHow many miles the moon might have in girth,\n  Of air-balloons, and of the many bars\nTo perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;—\nAnd then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.\n\nIn thoughts like these true wisdom may discern\n  Longings sublime, and aspirations high,\nWhich some are born with, but the most part learn\n  To plague themselves withal, they know not why:\n'T was strange that one so young should thus concern\n  His brain about the action of the sky;\nIf you think 't was philosophy that this did,\nI can't help thinking puberty assisted.\n\nHe pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,\n  And heard a voice in all the winds; and then\nHe thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,\n  And how the goddesses came down to men:\nHe miss'd the pathway, he forgot the hours,\n  And when he look'd upon his watch again,\nHe found how much old Time had been a winner—\nHe also found that he had lost his dinner.\n\nSometimes he turn'd to gaze upon his book,\n  Boscan, or Garcilasso;—by the wind\nEven as the page is rustled while we look,\n  So by the poesy of his own mind\nOver the mystic leaf his soul was shook,\n  As if 't were one whereon magicians bind\nTheir spells, and give them to the passing gale,\nAccording to some good old woman's tale.\n\nThus would he while his lonely hours away\n  Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;\nNor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay,\n  Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,\nA bosom whereon he his head might lay,\n  And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,\nWith—several other things, which I forget,\nOr which, at least, I need not mention yet.\n\nThose lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,\n  Could not escape the gentle Julia's eyes;\nShe saw that Juan was not at his ease;\n  But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,\nIs, that the Donna Inez did not tease\n  Her only son with question or surmise:\nWhether it was she did not see, or would not,\nOr, like all very clever people, could not.\n\nThis may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;\n  For instance—gentlemen, whose ladies take\nLeave to o'erstep the written rights of woman,\n  And break the—Which commandment is 't they break?\n(I have forgot the number, and think no man\n  Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)\nI say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,\nThey make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.\n\nA real husband always is suspicious,\n  But still no less suspects in the wrong place,\nJealous of some one who had no such wishes,\n  Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,\nBy harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;\n  The last indeed 's infallibly the case:\nAnd when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,\nHe wonders at their vice, and not his folly.\n\nThus parents also are at times short-sighted;\n  Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,\nThe while the wicked world beholds delighted,\n  Young Hopeful's mistress, or Miss Fanny's lover,\nTill some confounded escapade has blighted\n  The plan of twenty years, and all is over;\nAnd then the mother cries, the father swears,\nAnd wonders why the devil he got heirs.\n\nBut Inez was so anxious, and so clear\n  Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,\nShe had some other motive much more near\n  For leaving Juan to this new temptation;\nBut what that motive was, I sha'n't say here;\n  Perhaps to finish Juan's education,\nPerhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,\nIn case he thought his wife too great a prize.\n\nIt was upon a day, a summer's day.—\n  Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,\nAnd so is spring about the end of May;\n  The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;\nBut whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say,\n  And stand convicted of more truth than treason,\nThat there are months which nature grows more merry in,—\nMarch has its hares, and May must have its heroine.\n\n'T was on a summer's day—the sixth of June:—\n  I like to be particular in dates,\nNot only of the age, and year, but moon;\n  They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates\nChange horses, making history change its tune,\n  Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,\nLeaving at last not much besides chronology,\nExcepting the post-obits of theology.\n\n'T was on the sixth of June, about the hour\n  Of half-past six—perhaps still nearer seven—\nWhen Julia sate within as pretty a bower\n  As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven\nDescribed by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,\n  To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,\nWith all the trophies of triumphant song—\nHe won them well, and may he wear them long!\n\nShe sate, but not alone; I know not well\n  How this same interview had taken place,\nAnd even if I knew, I should not tell—\n  People should hold their tongues in any case;\nNo matter how or why the thing befell,\n  But there were she and Juan, face to face—\nWhen two such faces are so, 't would be wise,\nBut very difficult, to shut their eyes.\n\nHow beautiful she look'd! her conscious heart\n  Glow'd in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.\nO Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,\n  Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,\nHow self-deceitful is the sagest part\n  Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along—\nThe precipice she stood on was immense,\nSo was her creed in her own innocence.\n\nShe thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,\n  And of the folly of all prudish fears,\nVictorious virtue, and domestic truth,\n  And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:\nI wish these last had not occurr'd, in sooth,\n  Because that number rarely much endears,\nAnd through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,\nSounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.\n\nWhen people say, 'I've told you fifty times,'\n  They mean to scold, and very often do;\nWhen poets say, 'I've written fifty rhymes,'\n  They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;\nIn gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;\n  At fifty love for love is rare, 't is true,\nBut then, no doubt, it equally as true is,\nA good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.\n\nJulia had honour, virtue, truth, and love,\n  For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,\nBy all the vows below to powers above,\n  She never would disgrace the ring she wore,\nNor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;\n  And while she ponder'd this, besides much more,\nOne hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,\nQuite by mistake—she thought it was her own;\n\nUnconsciously she lean'd upon the other,\n  Which play'd within the tangles of her hair:\nAnd to contend with thoughts she could not smother\n  She seem'd by the distraction of her air.\n'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother\n  To leave together this imprudent pair,\nShe who for many years had watch'd her son so—\nI 'm very certain mine would not have done so.\n\nThe hand which still held Juan's, by degrees\n  Gently, but palpably confirm'd its grasp,\nAs if it said, 'Detain me, if you please;'\n  Yet there 's no doubt she only meant to clasp\nHis fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze:\n  She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,\nHad she imagined such a thing could rouse\nA feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.\n\nI cannot know what Juan thought of this,\n  But what he did, is much what you would do;\nHis young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss,\n  And then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew\nIn deep despair, lest he had done amiss,—\n  Love is so very timid when 't is new:\nShe blush'd, and frown'd not, but she strove to speak,\nAnd held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.\n\nThe sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:\n  The devil 's in the moon for mischief; they\nWho call'd her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon\n  Their nomenclature; there is not a day,\nThe longest, not the twenty-first of June,\n  Sees half the business in a wicked way\nOn which three single hours of moonshine smile—\nAnd then she looks so modest all the while.\n\nThere is a dangerous silence in that hour,\n  A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul\nTo open all itself, without the power\n  Of calling wholly back its self-control;\nThe silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,\n  Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,\nBreathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws\nA loving languor, which is not repose.\n\nAnd Julia sate with Juan, half embraced\n  And half retiring from the glowing arm,\nWhich trembled like the bosom where 't was placed;\n  Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,\nOr else 't were easy to withdraw her waist;\n  But then the situation had its charm,\nAnd then—God knows what next—I can't go on;\nI 'm almost sorry that I e'er begun.\n\nO Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,\n  With your confounded fantasies, to more\nImmoral conduct by the fancied sway\n  Your system feigns o'er the controulless core\nOf human hearts, than all the long array\n  Of poets and romancers:—You 're a bore,\nA charlatan, a coxcomb—and have been,\nAt best, no better than a go-between.\n\nAnd Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,\n  Until too late for useful conversation;\nThe tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,\n  I wish indeed they had not had occasion,\nBut who, alas! can love, and then be wise?\n  Not that remorse did not oppose temptation;\nA little still she strove, and much repented\nAnd whispering 'I will ne'er consent'—consented.\n\n'T is said that Xerxes offer'd a reward\n  To those who could invent him a new pleasure:\nMethinks the requisition 's rather hard,\n  And must have cost his majesty a treasure:\nFor my part, I 'm a moderate-minded bard,\n  Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);\nI care not for new pleasures, as the old\nAre quite enough for me, so they but hold.\n\nO Pleasure! you are indeed a pleasant thing,\n  Although one must be damn'd for you, no doubt:\nI make a resolution every spring\n  Of reformation, ere the year run out,\nBut somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,\n  Yet still, I trust it may be kept throughout:\nI 'm very sorry, very much ashamed,\nAnd mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim'd.\n\nHere my chaste Muse a liberty must take—\n  Start not! still chaster reader—she 'll be nice hence—\nForward, and there is no great cause to quake;\n  This liberty is a poetic licence,\nWhich some irregularity may make\n  In the design, and as I have a high sense\nOf Aristotle and the Rules, 't is fit\nTo beg his pardon when I err a bit.\n\nThis licence is to hope the reader will\n  Suppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,\nWithout whose epoch my poetic skill\n  For want of facts would all be thrown away),\nBut keeping Julia and Don Juan still\n  In sight, that several months have pass'd; we 'll say\n'T was in November, but I 'm not so sure\nAbout the day—the era 's more obscure.\n\nWe 'll talk of that anon.—'T is sweet to hear\n  At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep\nThe song and oar of Adria's gondolier,\n  By distance mellow'd, o'er the waters sweep;\n'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;\n  'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep\nFrom leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high\nThe rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.\n\n'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark\n  Bay deep-mouth'd welcome as we draw near home;\n'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark\n  Our coming, and look brighter when we come;\n'T is sweet to be awaken'd by the lark,\n  Or lull'd by falling waters; sweet the hum\nOf bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,\nThe lisp of children, and their earliest words.\n\nSweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes\n  In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,\nPurple and gushing: sweet are our escapes\n  From civic revelry to rural mirth;\nSweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,\n  Sweet to the father is his first-born's birth,\nSweet is revenge—especially to women,\nPillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.\n\nSweet is a legacy, and passing sweet\n  The unexpected death of some old lady\nOr gentleman of seventy years complete,\n  Who 've made 'us youth' wait too—too long already\nFor an estate, or cash, or country seat,\n  Still breaking, but with stamina so steady\nThat all the Israelites are fit to mob its\nNext owner for their double-damn'd post-obits.\n\n'T is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels,\n  By blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end\nTo strife; 't is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,\n  Particularly with a tiresome friend:\nSweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;\n  Dear is the helpless creature we defend\nAgainst the world; and dear the schoolboy spot\nWe ne'er forget, though there we are forgot.\n\nBut sweeter still than this, than these, than all,\n  Is first and passionate love—it stands alone,\nLike Adam's recollection of his fall;\n  The tree of knowledge has been pluck'd—all 's known—\nAnd life yields nothing further to recall\n  Worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,\nNo doubt in fable, as the unforgiven\nFire which Prometheus filch'd for us from heaven.\n\nMan 's a strange animal, and makes strange use\n  Of his own nature, and the various arts,\nAnd likes particularly to produce\n  Some new experiment to show his parts;\nThis is the age of oddities let loose,\n  Where different talents find their different marts;\nYou 'd best begin with truth, and when you 've lost your\nLabour, there 's a sure market for imposture.\n\nWhat opposite discoveries we have seen!\n  (Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)\nOne makes new noses, one a guillotine,\n  One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;\nBut vaccination certainly has been\n  A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets,\nWith which the Doctor paid off an old pox,\nBy borrowing a new one from an ox.\n\nBread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;\n  And galvanism has set some corpses grinning,\nBut has not answer'd like the apparatus\n  Of the Humane Society's beginning\nBy which men are unsuffocated gratis:\n  What wondrous new machines have late been spinning!\nI said the small-pox has gone out of late;\nPerhaps it may be follow'd by the great.\n\n'T is said the great came from America;\n  Perhaps it may set out on its return,—\nThe population there so spreads, they say\n  'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,\nWith war, or plague, or famine, any way,\n  So that civilisation they may learn;\nAnd which in ravage the more loathsome evil is—\nTheir real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?\n\nThis is the patent-age of new inventions\n  For killing bodies, and for saving souls,\nAll propagated with the best intentions;\n  Sir Humphry Davy's lantern, by which coals\nAre safely mined for in the mode he mentions,\n  Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,\nAre ways to benefit mankind, as true,\nPerhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.\n\nMan 's a phenomenon, one knows not what,\n  And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;\n'T is pity though, in this sublime world, that\n  Pleasure 's a sin, and sometimes sin 's a pleasure;\nFew mortals know what end they would be at,\n  But whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,\nThe path is through perplexing ways, and when\nThe goal is gain'd, we die, you know—and then—\n\nWhat then?—I do not know, no more do you—\n  And so good night.—Return we to our story:\n'T was in November, when fine days are few,\n  And the far mountains wax a little hoary,\nAnd clap a white cape on their mantles blue;\n  And the sea dashes round the promontory,\nAnd the loud breaker boils against the rock,\nAnd sober suns must set at five o'clock.\n\n'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;\n  No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud\nBy gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright\n  With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;\nThere 's something cheerful in that sort of light,\n  Even as a summer sky 's without a cloud:\nI 'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,\nA lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.\n\n'T was midnight—Donna Julia was in bed,\n  Sleeping, most probably,—when at her door\nArose a clatter might awake the dead,\n  If they had never been awoke before,\nAnd that they have been so we all have read,\n  And are to be so, at the least, once more.—\nThe door was fasten'd, but with voice and fist\nFirst knocks were heard, then 'Madam—Madam—hist!\n\n'For God's sake, Madam—Madam—here 's my master,\n  With more than half the city at his back—\nWas ever heard of such a curst disaster!\n  'T is not my fault—I kept good watch—Alack!\nDo pray undo the bolt a little faster—\n  They 're on the stair just now, and in a crack\nWill all be here; perhaps he yet may fly—\nSurely the window 's not so very high!'\n\nBy this time Don Alfonso was arrived,\n  With torches, friends, and servants in great number;\nThe major part of them had long been wived,\n  And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber\nOf any wicked woman, who contrived\n  By stealth her husband's temples to encumber:\nExamples of this kind are so contagious,\nWere one not punish'd, all would be outrageous.\n\nI can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion\n  Could enter into Don Alfonso's head;\nBut for a cavalier of his condition\n  It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,\nWithout a word of previous admonition,\n  To hold a levee round his lady's bed,\nAnd summon lackeys, arm'd with fire and sword,\nTo prove himself the thing he most abhorr'd.\n\nPoor Donna Julia, starting as from sleep\n  (Mind—that I do not say—she had not slept),\nBegan at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;\n  Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,\nContrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,\n  As if she had just now from out them crept:\nI can't tell why she should take all this trouble\nTo prove her mistress had been sleeping double.\n\nBut Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,\n  Appear'd like two poor harmless women, who\nOf goblins, but still more of men afraid,\n  Had thought one man might be deterr'd by two,\nAnd therefore side by side were gently laid,\n  Until the hours of absence should run through,\nAnd truant husband should return, and say,\n'My dear, I was the first who came away.'\n\nNow Julia found at length a voice, and cried,\n  'In heaven's name, Don Alfonso, what d' ye mean?\nHas madness seized you? would that I had died\n  Ere such a monster's victim I had been!\nWhat may this midnight violence betide,\n  A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?\nDare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?\nSearch, then, the room!'—Alfonso said, 'I will.'\n\nHe search'd, they search'd, and rummaged everywhere,\n  Closet and clothes' press, chest and window-seat,\nAnd found much linen, lace, and several pair\n  Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,\nWith other articles of ladies fair,\n  To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:\nArras they prick'd and curtains with their swords,\nAnd wounded several shutters, and some boards.\n\nUnder the bed they search'd, and there they found—\n  No matter what—it was not that they sought;\nThey open'd windows, gazing if the ground\n  Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;\nAnd then they stared each other's faces round:\n  'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,\nAnd seems to me almost a sort of blunder,\nOf looking in the bed as well as under.\n\nDuring this inquisition, Julia's tongue\n  Was not asleep—'Yes, search and search,' she cried,\n'Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!\n  It was for this that I became a bride!\nFor this in silence I have suffer'd long\n  A husband like Alfonso at my side;\nBut now I 'll bear no more, nor here remain,\nIf there be law or lawyers in all Spain.\n\n'Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,\n  If ever you indeed deserved the name,\nIs 't worthy of your years?—you have threescore—\n  Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same—\nIs 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore\n  For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?\nUngrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,\nHow dare you think your lady would go on so?\n\n'Is it for this I have disdain'd to hold\n  The common privileges of my sex?\nThat I have chosen a confessor so old\n  And deaf, that any other it would vex,\nAnd never once he has had cause to scold,\n  But found my very innocence perplex\nSo much, he always doubted I was married—\nHow sorry you will be when I 've miscarried!\n\n'Was it for this that no Cortejo e'er\n  I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?\nIs it for this I scarce went anywhere,\n  Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?\nIs it for this, whate'er my suitors were,\n  I favor'd none—nay, was almost uncivil?\nIs it for this that General Count O'Reilly,\nWho took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?\n\n'Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani\n  Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?\nDid not his countryman, Count Corniani,\n  Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?\nWere there not also Russians, English, many?\n  The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,\nAnd Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,\nWho kill'd himself for love (with wine) last year.\n\n'Have I not had two bishops at my feet,\n  The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez?\nAnd is it thus a faithful wife you treat?\n  I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:\nI praise your vast forbearance not to beat\n  Me also, since the time so opportune is—\nO, valiant man! with sword drawn and cock'd trigger,\nNow, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure?\n\n'Was it for this you took your sudden journey.\n  Under pretence of business indispensable\nWith that sublime of rascals your attorney,\n  Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible\nOf having play'd the fool? though both I spurn, he\n  Deserves the worst, his conduct 's less defensible,\nBecause, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,\nAnd not from any love to you nor me.\n\n'If he comes here to take a deposition,\n  By all means let the gentleman proceed;\nYou 've made the apartment in a fit condition:\n  There 's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need—\nLet every thing be noted with precision,\n  I would not you for nothing should be fee'd—\nBut, as my maid 's undrest, pray turn your spies out.'\n'Oh!' sobb'd Antonia, 'I could tear their eyes out.'\n\n'There is the closet, there the toilet, there\n  The antechamber—search them under, over;\nThere is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,\n  The chimney—which would really hold a lover.\nI wish to sleep, and beg you will take care\n  And make no further noise, till you discover\nThe secret cavern of this lurking treasure—\nAnd when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.\n\n'And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown\n  Doubt upon me, confusion over all,\nPray have the courtesy to make it known\n  Who is the man you search for? how d' ye cal\nHim? what 's his lineage? let him but be shown—\n  I hope he 's young and handsome—is he tall?\nTell me—and be assured, that since you stain\nMy honour thus, it shall not be in vain.\n\n'At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,\n  At that age he would be too old for slaughter,\nOr for so young a husband's jealous fears\n  (Antonia! let me have a glass of water).\nI am ashamed of having shed these tears,\n  They are unworthy of my father's daughter;\nMy mother dream'd not in my natal hour\nThat I should fall into a monster's power.\n\n'Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,\n  You saw that she was sleeping by my side\nWhen you broke in upon us with your fellows:\n  Look where you please—we 've nothing, sir, to hide;\nOnly another time, I trust, you 'll tell us,\n  Or for the sake of decency abide\nA moment at the door, that we may be\nDrest to receive so much good company.\n\n'And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;\n  The little I have said may serve to show\nThe guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er\n  The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:\nI leave you to your conscience as before,\n  'T will one day ask you why you used me so?\nGod grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!-\nAntonia! where 's my pocket-handkerchief?'\n\nShe ceased, and turn'd upon her pillow; pale\n  She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,\nLike skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,\n  Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears\nHer streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,\n  To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears\nIts snow through all;—her soft lips lie apart,\nAnd louder than her breathing beats her heart.\n\nThe Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;\n  Antonia bustled round the ransack'd room,\nAnd, turning up her nose, with looks abused\n  Her master and his myrmidons, of whom\nNot one, except the attorney, was amused;\n  He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,\nSo there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,\nKnowing they must be settled by the laws.\n\nWith prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,\n  Following Antonia's motions here and there,\nWith much suspicion in his attitude;\n  For reputations he had little care;\nSo that a suit or action were made good,\n  Small pity had he for the young and fair,\nAnd ne'er believed in negatives, till these\nWere proved by competent false witnesses.\n\nBut Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,\n  And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;\nWhen, after searching in five hundred nooks,\n  And treating a young wife with so much rigour,\nHe gain'd no point, except some self-rebukes,\n  Added to those his lady with such vigour\nHad pour'd upon him for the last half-hour,\nQuick, thick, and heavy—as a thunder-shower.\n\nAt first he tried to hammer an excuse,\n  To which the sole reply was tears and sobs,\nAnd indications of hysterics, whose\n  Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,\nGasps, and whatever else the owners choose:\n  Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;\nHe saw too, in perspective, her relations,\nAnd then he tried to muster all his patience.\n\nHe stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,\n  But sage Antonia cut him short before\nThe anvil of his speech received the hammer,\n  With 'Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,\nOr madam dies.'—Alfonso mutter'd, 'D—n her,'\n  But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;\nHe cast a rueful look or two, and did,\nHe knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.\n\nWith him retired his 'posse comitatus,'\n  The attorney last, who linger'd near the door\nReluctantly, still tarrying there as late as\n  Antonia let him—not a little sore\nAt this most strange and unexplain'd 'hiatus'\n  In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore\nAn awkward look; as he revolved the case,\nThe door was fasten'd in his legal face.\n\nNo sooner was it bolted, than—Oh shame!\n  O sin! Oh sorrow! and oh womankind!\nHow can you do such things and keep your fame,\n  Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?\nNothing so dear as an unfilch'd good name!\n  But to proceed—for there is more behind:\nWith much heartfelt reluctance be it said,\nYoung Juan slipp'd half-smother'd, from the bed.\n\nHe had been hid—I don't pretend to say\n  How, nor can I indeed describe the where—\nYoung, slender, and pack'd easily, he lay,\n  No doubt, in little compass, round or square;\nBut pity him I neither must nor may\n  His suffocation by that pretty pair;\n'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut\nWith maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.\n\nAnd, secondly, I pity not, because\n  He had no business to commit a sin,\nForbid by heavenly, fined by human laws,\n  At least 't was rather early to begin;\nBut at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws\n  So much as when we call our old debts in\nAt sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,\nAnd find a deuced balance with the devil.\n\nOf his position I can give no notion:\n  'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,\nHow the physicians, leaving pill and potion,\n  Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,\nWhen old King David's blood grew dull in motion,\n  And that the medicine answer'd very well;\nPerhaps 't was in a different way applied,\nFor David lived, but Juan nearly died.\n\nWhat 's to be done? Alfonso will be back\n  The moment he has sent his fools away.\nAntonia's skill was put upon the rack,\n  But no device could be brought into play—\nAnd how to parry the renew'd attack?\n  Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:\nAntonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,\nBut press'd her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.\n\nHe turn'd his lip to hers, and with his hand\n  Call'd back the tangles of her wandering hair;\nEven then their love they could not all command,\n  And half forgot their danger and despair:\nAntonia's patience now was at a stand—\n  'Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,'\nShe whisper'd, in great wrath—'I must deposit\nThis pretty gentleman within the closet:\n\n'Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night—\n  Who can have put my master in this mood?\nWhat will become on 't—I 'm in such a fright,\n  The devil 's in the urchin, and no good—\nIs this a time for giggling? this a plight?\n  Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?\nYou 'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,\nMy mistress all, for that half-girlish face.\n\n'Had it but been for a stout cavalier\n  Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)—\nBut for a child, what piece of work is here!\n  I really, madam, wonder at your taste\n(Come, sir, get in)—my master must be near:\n  There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,\nAnd if we can but till the morning keep\nOur counsel—(Juan, mind, you must not sleep).'\n\nNow, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,\n  Closed the oration of the trusty maid:\nShe loiter'd, and he told her to be gone,\n  An order somewhat sullenly obey'd;\nHowever, present remedy was none,\n  And no great good seem'd answer'd if she stay'd:\nRegarding both with slow and sidelong view,\nShe snuff'd the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.\n\nAlfonso paused a minute—then begun\n  Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;\nHe would not justify what he had done,\n  To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;\nBut there were ample reasons for it, none\n  Of which he specified in this his pleading:\nHis speech was a fine sample, on the whole,\nOf rhetoric, which the learn'd call 'rigmarole.'\n\nJulia said nought; though all the while there rose\n  A ready answer, which at once enables\nA matron, who her husband's foible knows,\n  By a few timely words to turn the tables,\nWhich, if it does not silence, still must pose,—\n  Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;\n'T is to retort with firmness, and when he\nSuspects with one, do you reproach with three.\n\nJulia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,—\n  Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known,\nBut whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds—\n  But that can't be, as has been often shown,\nA lady with apologies abounds;—\n  It might be that her silence sprang alone\nFrom delicacy to Don Juan's ear,\nTo whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.\n\nThere might be one more motive, which makes two;\n  Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,—\nMention'd his jealousy but never who\n  Had been the happy lover, he concluded,\nConceal'd amongst his premises; 't is true,\n  His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;\nTo speak of Inez now were, one may say,\nLike throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.\n\nA hint, in tender cases, is enough;\n  Silence is best, besides there is a tact\n(That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,\n  But it will serve to keep my verse compact)—\nWhich keeps, when push'd by questions rather rough,\n  A lady always distant from the fact:\nThe charming creatures lie with such a grace,\nThere 's nothing so becoming to the face.\n\nThey blush, and we believe them; at least I\n  Have always done so; 't is of no great use,\nIn any case, attempting a reply,\n  For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;\nAnd when at length they 're out of breath, they sigh,\n  And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose\nA tear or two, and then we make it up;\nAnd then—and then—and then—sit down and sup.\n\nAlfonso closed his speech, and begg'd her pardon,\n  Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,\nAnd laid conditions he thought very hard on,\n  Denying several little things he wanted:\nHe stood like Adam lingering near his garden,\n  With useless penitence perplex'd and haunted,\nBeseeching she no further would refuse,\nWhen, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.\n\nA pair of shoes!—what then? not much, if they\n  Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these\n(No one can tell how much I grieve to say)\n  Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,\nWas but a moment's act.—Ah! well-a-day!\n  My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze—\nAlfonso first examined well their fashion,\nAnd then flew out into another passion.\n\nHe left the room for his relinquish'd sword,\n  And Julia instant to the closet flew.\n'Fly, Juan, fly! for heaven's sake—not a word—\n  The door is open—you may yet slip through\nThe passage you so often have explored—\n  Here is the garden-key—Fly—fly—Adieu!\nHaste—haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet—\nDay has not broke—there 's no one in the street:\n\nNone can say that this was not good advice,\n  The only mischief was, it came too late;\nOf all experience 't is the usual price,\n  A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:\nJuan had reach'd the room-door in a. trice,\n  And might have done so by the garden-gate,\nBut met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,\nWho threaten'd death—so Juan knock'd him down.\n\nDire was the scuffle, and out went the light;\n  Antonia cried out 'Rape!' and Julia 'Fire!'\nBut not a servant stirr'd to aid the fight.\n  Alfonso, pommell'd to his heart's desire,\nSwore lustily he'd be revenged this night;\n  And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;\nHis blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,\nAnd not at all disposed to prove a martyr.\n\nAlfonso's sword had dropp'd ere he could draw it,\n  And they continued battling hand to hand,\nFor Juan very luckily ne'er saw it;\n  His temper not being under great command,\nIf at that moment he had chanced to claw it,\n  Alfonso's days had not been in the land\nMuch longer.—Think of husbands', lovers' lives!\nAnd how ye may be doubly widows—wives!\n\nAlfonso grappled to detain the foe,\n  And Juan throttled him to get away,\nAnd blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow;\n  At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,\nJuan contrived to give an awkward blow,\n  And then his only garment quite gave way;\nHe fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,\nI doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.\n\nLights came at length, and men, and maids, who found\n  An awkward spectacle their eyes before;\nAntonia in hysterics, Julia swoon'd,\n  Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;\nSome half-torn drapery scatter'd on the ground,\n  Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:\nJuan the gate gain'd, turn'd the key about,\nAnd liking not the inside, lock'd the out.\n\nHere ends this canto.—Need I sing, or say,\n  How Juan naked, favour'd by the night,\nWho favours what she should not, found his way,\n  And reach'd his home in an unseemly plight?\nThe pleasant scandal which arose next day,\n  The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,\nAnd how Alfonso sued for a divorce,\nWere in the English newspapers, of course.\n\nIf you would like to see the whole proceedings,\n  The depositions, and the cause at full,\nThe names of all the witnesses, the pleadings\n  Of counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,\nThere 's more than one edition, and the readings\n  Are various, but they none of them are dull;\nThe best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney,\nWho to Madrid on purpose made a journey.\n\nBut Donna Inez, to divert the train\n  Of one of the most circulating scandals\nThat had for centuries been known in Spain,\n  At least since the retirement of the Vandals,\nFirst vow'd (and never had she vow'd in vain)\n  To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;\nAnd then, by the advice of some old ladies,\nShe sent her son to be shipp'd off from Cadiz.\n\nShe had resolved that he should travel through\n  All European climes, by land or sea,\nTo mend his former morals, and get new,\n  Especially in France and Italy\n(At least this is the thing most people do).\n  Julia was sent into a convent: she\nGrieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better\nShown in the following copy of her Letter:—\n\n'They tell me 't is decided; you depart:\n  'T is wise—'t is well, but not the less a pain;\nI have no further claim on your young heart,\n  Mine is the victim, and would be again;\nTo love too much has been the only art\n  I used;—I write in haste, and if a stain\nBe on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;\nMy eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.\n\n'I loved, I love you, for this love have lost\n  State, station, heaven, mankind's, my own esteem,\nAnd yet can not regret what it hath cost,\n  So dear is still the memory of that dream;\nYet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,\n  None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:\nI trace this scrawl because I cannot rest—\nI 've nothing to reproach, or to request.\n\n'Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,\n  'T is woman's whole existence; man may range\nThe court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart;\n  Sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange\nPride, fame, ambition, to fill up his heart,\n  And few there are whom these cannot estrange;\nMen have all these resources, we but one,\nTo love again, and be again undone.\n\n'You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,\n  Beloved and loving many; all is o'er\nFor me on earth, except some years to hide\n  My shame and sorrow deep in my heart's core;\nThese I could bear, but cannot cast aside\n  The passion which still rages as before—\nAnd so farewell—forgive me, love me—No,\nThat word is idle now—but let it go.\n\n'My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;\n  But still I think I can collect my mind;\nMy blood still rushes where my spirit 's set,\n  As roll the waves before the settled wind;\nMy heart is feminine, nor can forget—\n  To all, except one image, madly blind;\nSo shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,\nAs vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.\n\n'I have no more to say, but linger still,\n  And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,\nAnd yet I may as well the task fulfil,\n  My misery can scarce be more complete:\nI had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;\n  Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,\nAnd I must even survive this last adieu,\nAnd bear with life, to love and pray for you!'\n\nThis note was written upon gilt-edged paper\n  With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new:\nHer small white hand could hardly reach the taper,\n  It trembled as magnetic needles do,\nAnd yet she did not let one tear escape her;\n  The seal a sun-flower; 'Elle vous suit partout,'\nThe motto cut upon a white cornelian;\nThe wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.\n\nThis was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether\n  I shall proceed with his adventures is\nDependent on the public altogether;\n  We 'll see, however, what they say to this:\nTheir favour in an author's cap 's a feather,\n  And no great mischief 's done by their caprice;\nAnd if their approbation we experience,\nPerhaps they 'll have some more about a year hence.\n\nMy poem 's epic, and is meant to be\n  Divided in twelve books; each book containing,\nWith love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,\n  A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,\nNew characters; the episodes are three:\n  A panoramic view of hell 's in training,\nAfter the style of Virgil and of Homer,\nSo that my name of Epic 's no misnomer.\n\nAll these things will be specified in time,\n  With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,\nThe Vade Mecum of the true sublime,\n  Which makes so many poets, and some fools:\nProse poets like blank-verse, I 'm fond of rhyme,\n  Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;\nI 've got new mythological machinery,\nAnd very handsome supernatural scenery.\n\nThere 's only one slight difference between\n  Me and my epic brethren gone before,\nAnd here the advantage is my own, I ween\n  (Not that I have not several merits more,\nBut this will more peculiarly be seen);\n  They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore\nTheir labyrinth of fables to thread through,\nWhereas this story 's actually true.\n\nIf any person doubt it, I appeal\n  To history, tradition, and to facts,\nTo newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,\n  To plays in five, and operas in three acts;\nAll these confirm my statement a good deal,\n  But that which more completely faith exacts\nIs that myself, and several now in Seville,\nSaw Juan's last elopement with the devil.\n\nIf ever I should condescend to prose,\n  I 'll write poetical commandments, which\nShall supersede beyond all doubt all those\n  That went before; in these I shall enrich\nMy text with many things that no one knows,\n  And carry precept to the highest pitch:\nI 'll call the work 'Longinus o'er a Bottle,\nOr, Every Poet his own Aristotle.'\n\nThou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;\n  Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;\nBecause the first is crazed beyond all hope,\n  The second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:\nWith Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,\n  And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:\nThou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor\nCommit—flirtation with the muse of Moore.\n\nThou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,\n  His Pegasus, nor anything that 's his;\nThou shalt not bear false witness like 'the Blues'\n  (There 's one, at least, is very fond of this);\nThou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:\n  This is true criticism, and you may kiss—\nExactly as you please, or not,—the rod;\n\nIf any person should presume to assert\n  This story is not moral, first, I pray,\nThat they will not cry out before they 're hurt,\n  Then that they 'll read it o'er again, and say\n(But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)\n  That this is not a moral tale, though gay;\nBesides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show\nThe very place where wicked people go.\n\nIf, after all, there should be some so blind\n  To their own good this warning to despise,\nLed by some tortuosity of mind,\n  Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,\nAnd cry that they 'the moral cannot find,'\n  I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;\nShould captains the remark, or critics, make,\nThey also lie too—under a mistake.\n\nThe public approbation I expect,\n  And beg they 'll take my word about the moral,\nWhich I with their amusement will connect\n  (So children cutting teeth receive a coral);\nMeantime, they 'll doubtless please to recollect\n  My epical pretensions to the laurel:\nFor fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,\nI 've bribed my grandmother's review—the British.\n\nI sent it in a letter to the Editor,\n  Who thank'd me duly by return of post—\nI 'm for a handsome article his creditor;\n  Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,\nAnd break a promise after having made it her,\n  Denying the receipt of what it cost,\nAnd smear his page with gall instead of honey,\nAll I can say is—that he had the money.\n\nI think that with this holy new alliance\n  I may ensure the public, and defy\nAll other magazines of art or science,\n  Daily, or monthly, or three monthly; I\nHave not essay'd to multiply their clients,\n  Because they tell me 't were in vain to try,\nAnd that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly\nTreat a dissenting author very martyrly.\n\n'Non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa\n  Consule Planco,' Horace said, and so\nSay I; by which quotation there is meant a\n  Hint that some six or seven good years ago\n(Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)\n  I was most ready to return a blow,\nAnd would not brook at all this sort of thing\nIn my hot youth—when George the Third was King.\n\nBut now at thirty years my hair is grey\n  (I wonder what it will be like at forty?\nI thought of a peruke the other day)—\n  My heart is not much greener; and, in short, I\nHave squander'd my whole summer while 't was May,\n  And feel no more the spirit to retort; I\nHave spent my life, both interest and principal,\nAnd deem not, what I deem'd, my soul invincible.\n\nNo more—no more—Oh! never more on me\n  The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,\nWhich out of all the lovely things we see\n  Extracts emotions beautiful and new,\nHived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee:\n  Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?\nAlas! 't was not in them, but in thy power\nTo double even the sweetness of a flower.\n\nNo more—no more—Oh! never more, my heart,\n  Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!\nOnce all in all, but now a thing apart,\n  Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:\nThe illusion 's gone for ever, and thou art\n  Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,\nAnd in thy stead I 've got a deal of judgment,\nThough heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.\n\nMy days of love are over; me no more\n  The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,\nCan make the fool of which they made before,—\n  In short, I must not lead the life I did do;\nThe credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,\n  The copious use of claret is forbid too,\nSo for a good old-gentlemanly vice,\nI think I must take up with avarice.\n\nAmbition was my idol, which was broken\n  Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;\nAnd the two last have left me many a token\n  O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:\nNow, like Friar Bacon's brazen head, I 've spoken,\n  'Time is, Time was, Time 's past:'—a chymic treasure\nIs glittering youth, which I have spent betimes—\nMy heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.\n\nWhat is the end of Fame? 't is but to fill\n  A certain portion of uncertain paper:\nSome liken it to climbing up a hill,\n  Whose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;\nFor this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,\n  And bards burn what they call their 'midnight taper,'\nTo have, when the original is dust,\nA name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.\n\nWhat are the hopes of man? Old Egypt's King\n  Cheops erected the first pyramid\nAnd largest, thinking it was just the thing\n  To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;\nBut somebody or other rummaging,\n  Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:\nLet not a monument give you or me hopes,\nSince not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.\n\nBut I being fond of true philosophy,\n  Say very often to myself, 'Alas!\nAll things that have been born were born to die,\n  And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;\nYou 've pass'd your youth not so unpleasantly,\n  And if you had it o'er again—'t would pass—\nSo thank your stars that matters are no worse,\nAnd read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.'\n\nBut for the present, gentle reader! and\n  Still gentler purchaser! the bard—that 's I—\nMust, with permission, shake you by the hand,\n  And so 'Your humble servant, and good-b'ye!'\nWe meet again, if we should understand\n  Each other; and if not, I shall not try\nYour patience further than by this short sample—\n'T were well if others follow'd my example.\n\n'Go, little book, from this my solitude!\n  I cast thee on the waters—go thy ways!\nAnd if, as I believe, thy vein be good,\n  The world will find thee after many days.'\nWhen Southey's read, and Wordsworth understood,\n  I can't help putting in my claim to praise—\nThe four first rhymes are Southey's every line:\nFor God's sake, reader! take them not for mine.</code>"

to dwell\nUpon such things would very near absorb\n  A canto—then their feet and ankles,—well,\nThank Heaven I 've got no metaphor quite ready\n(And so, my sober Muse—come, let 's be steady—\n\nChaste Muse!—well, if you must, you must)—the veil\n  Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,\nWhile the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,\n  Flashes into the heart:—All sunny land\nOf love! when I forget you, may I fail\n  To—say my prayers—but never was there plann'd\nA dress through which the eyes give such a volley,\nExcepting the Venetian Fazzioli.\n\nBut to our tale: the Donna Inez sent\n  Her son to Cadiz only to embark;\nTo stay there had not answer'd her intent,\n  But why?—we leave the reader in the dark—\n'T was for a voyage that the young man was meant,\n  As if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,\nTo wean him from the wickedness of earth,\nAnd send him like a dove of promise forth.\n\nDon Juan bade his valet pack his things\n  According to direction, then received\nA lecture and some money: for four springs\n  He was to travel; and though Inez grieved\n(As every kind of parting has its stings),\n  She hoped he would improve—perhaps believed:\nA letter, too, she gave (he never read it)\nOf good advice—and two or three of credit.\n\nIn the mean time, to pass her hours away,\n  Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school\nFor naughty children, who would rather play\n  (Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;\nInfants of three years old were taught that day,\n  Dunces were whipt, or set upon a stool:\nThe great success of Juan's education,\nSpurr'd her to teach another generation.\n\nJuan embark'd—the ship got under way,\n  The wind was fair, the water passing rough:\nA devil of a sea rolls in that bay,\n  As I, who 've cross'd it oft, know well enough;\nAnd, standing upon deck, the dashing spray\n  Flies in one's face, and makes it weather-tough:\nAnd there he stood to take, and take again,\nHis first—perhaps his last—farewell of Spain.\n\nI can't but say it is an awkward sight\n  To see one's native land receding through\nThe growing waters; it unmans one quite,\n  Especially when life is rather new:\nI recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,\n  But almost every other country 's blue,\nWhen gazing on them, mystified by distance,\nWe enter on our nautical existence.\n\nSo Juan stood, bewilder'd on the deck:\n  The wind sung, cordage strain'd, and sailors swore,\nAnd the ship creak'd, the town became a speck,\n  From which away so fair and fast they bore.\nThe best of remedies is a beef-steak\n  Against sea-sickness: try it, sir, before\nYou sneer, and I assure you this is true,\nFor I have found it answer—so may you.\n\nDon Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,\n  Beheld his native Spain receding far:\nFirst partings form a lesson hard to learn,\n  Even nations feel this when they go to war;\nThere is a sort of unexprest concern,\n  A kind of shock that sets one's heart ajar:\nAt leaving even the most unpleasant people\nAnd places, one keeps looking at the steeple.\n\nBut Juan had got many things to leave,\n  His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,\nSo that he had much better cause to grieve\n  Than many persons more advanced in life;\nAnd if we now and then a sigh must heave\n  At quitting even those we quit in strife,\nNo doubt we weep for those the heart endears—\nThat is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.\n\nSo Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews\n  By Babel's waters, still remembering Sion:\nI 'd weep,—but mine is not a weeping Muse,\n  And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;\nYoung men should travel, if but to amuse\n  Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on\nBehind their carriages their new portmanteau,\nPerhaps it may be lined with this my canto.\n\nAnd Juan wept, and much he sigh'd and thought,\n  While his salt tears dropp'd into the salt sea,\n'Sweets to the sweet' (I like so much to quote;\n  You must excuse this extract, 't is where she,\nThe Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought\n  Flowers to the grave); and, sobbing often, he\nReflected on his present situation,\nAnd seriously resolved on reformation.\n\n'Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!' he cried,\n  'Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,\nBut die, as many an exiled heart hath died,\n  Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:\nFarewell, where Guadalquivir's waters glide!\n  Farewell, my mother! and, since all is o'er,\nFarewell, too, dearest Julia!—(Here he drew\nHer letter out again, and read it through.)\n\n'And, oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear—\n  But that 's impossible, and cannot be—\nSooner shall this blue ocean melt to air,\n  Sooner shall earth resolve itself to sea,\nThan I resign thine image, oh, my fair!\n  Or think of any thing excepting thee;\nA mind diseased no remedy can physic\n(Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick).\n\n'Sooner shall heaven kiss earth (here he fell sicker),\n  O, Julia! what is every other wo?\n(For God's sake let me have a glass of liquor;\n  Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)\nJulia, my love! (you rascal, Pedro, quicker)—\n  O, Julia! (this curst vessel pitches so)—\nBeloved Julia, hear me still beseeching!'\n(Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)\n\nHe felt that chilling heaviness of heart,\n  Or rather stomach, which, alas! attends,\nBeyond the best apothecary's art,\n  The loss of love, the treachery of friends,\nOr death of those we dote on, when a part\n  Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:\nNo doubt he would have been much more pathetic,\nBut the sea acted as a strong emetic. I\n\nLove 's a capricious power: I 've known it hold\n  Out through a fever caused by its own heat,\nBut be much puzzled by a cough and cold,\n  And find a quincy very hard to treat;\nAgainst all noble maladies he 's bold,\n  But vulgar illnesses don't like to meet,\nNor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,\nNor inflammations redden his blind eye.\n\nBut worst of all is nausea, or a pain\n  About the lower region of the bowels;\nLove, who heroically breathes a vein,\n  Shrinks from the application of hot towels,\nAnd purgatives are dangerous to his reign,\n  Sea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else\nCould Juan's passion, while the billows roar,\nResist his stomach, ne'er at sea before?\n\nThe ship, call'd the most holy 'Trinidada,'\n  Was steering duly for the port Leghorn;\nFor there the Spanish family Moncada\n  Were settled long ere Juan's sire was born:\nThey were relations, and for them he had a\n  Letter of introduction, which the morn\nOf his departure had been sent him by\nHis Spanish friends for those in Italy.\n\nHis suite consisted of three servants and\n  A tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,\nWho several languages did understand,\n  But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,\nAnd rocking in his hammock, long'd for land,\n  His headache being increased by every billow;\nAnd the waves oozing through the port-hole made\nHis berth a little damp, and him afraid.\n\n'T was not without some reason, for the wind\n  Increased at night, until it blew a gale;\nAnd though 't was not much to a naval mind,\n  Some landsmen would have look'd a little pale,\nFor sailors are, in fact, a different kind:\n  At sunset they began to take in sail,\nFor the sky show'd it would come on to blow,\nAnd carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.\n\nAt one o'clock the wind with sudden shift\n  Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,\nWhich struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,\n  Started the stern-post, also shatter'd the\nWhole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift\n  Herself from out her present jeopardy,\nThe rudder tore away: 't was time to sound\nThe pumps, and there were four feet water found.\n\nOne gang of people instantly was put\n  Upon the pumps and the remainder set\nTo get up part of the cargo, and what not;\n  But they could not come at the leak as yet;\nAt last they did get at it really, but\n  Still their salvation was an even bet:\nThe water rush'd through in a way quite puzzling,\nWhile they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,\n\nInto the opening; but all such ingredients\n  Would have been vain, and they must have gone down,\nDespite of all their efforts and expedients,\n  But for the pumps: I 'm glad to make them known\nTo all the brother tars who may have need hence,\n  For fifty tons of water were upthrown\nBy them per hour, and they had all been undone,\nBut for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.\n\nAs day advanced the weather seem'd to abate,\n  And then the leak they reckon'd to reduce,\nAnd keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet\n  Kept two hand and one chain-pump still in use.\nThe wind blew fresh again: as it grew late\n  A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,\nA gust—which all descriptive power transcends—\nLaid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.\n\nThere she lay motionless, and seem'd upset;\n  The water left the hold, and wash'd the decks,\nAnd made a scene men do not soon forget;\n  For they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,\nOr any other thing that brings regret,\n  Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:\nThus drownings are much talk'd of by the divers,\nAnd swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.\n\nImmediately the masts were cut away,\n  Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,\nThe main-mast follow'd: but the ship still lay\n  Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.\nForemast and bowsprit were cut down, and they\n  Eased her at last (although we never meant\nTo part with all till every hope was blighted),\nAnd then with violence the old ship righted.\n\nIt may be easily supposed, while this\n  Was going on, some people were unquiet,\nThat passengers would find it much amiss\n  To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;\nThat even the able seaman, deeming his\n  Days nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,\nAs upon such occasions tars will ask\nFor grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.\n\nThere 's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms\n  As rum and true religion: thus it was,\nSome plunder'd, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,\n  The high wind made the treble, and as bas\nThe hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms\n  Of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:\nStrange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,\nClamour'd in chorus to the roaring ocean.\n\nPerhaps more mischief had been done, but for\n  Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,\nGot to the spirit-room, and stood before\n  It with a pair of pistols; and their fears,\nAs if Death were more dreadful by his door\n  Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,\nKept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,\nThought it would be becoming to die drunk.\n\n'Give us more grog,' they cried, 'for it will be\n  All one an hour hence.' Juan answer'd, 'No!\n'T is true that death awaits both you and me,\n  But let us die like men, not sink below\nLike brutes;'—and thus his dangerous post kept he,\n  And none liked to anticipate the blow;\nAnd even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,\nWas for some rum a disappointed suitor.\n\nThe good old gentleman was quite aghast,\n  And made a loud and pious lamentation;\nRepented all his sins, and made a last\n  Irrevocable vow of reformation;\nNothing should tempt him more (this peril past)\n  To quit his academic occupation,\nIn cloisters of the classic Salamanca,\nTo follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca.\n\nBut now there came a flash of hope once more;\n  Day broke, and the wind lull'd: the masts were gone,\nThe leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,\n  The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.\nThey tried the pumps again, and though before\n  Their desperate efforts seem'd all useless grown,\nA glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale—\nThe stronger pump'd, the weaker thrumm'd a sail.\n\nUnder the vessel's keel the sail was past,\n  And for the moment it had some effect;\nBut with a leak, and not a stick of mast,\n  Nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?\nBut still 't is best to struggle to the last,\n  'T is never too late to be wholly wreck'd:\nAnd though 't is true that man can only die once,\n'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.\n\nThere winds and waves had hurl'd them, and from thence,\n  Without their will, they carried them away;\nFor they were forced with steering to dispense,\n  And never had as yet a quiet day\nOn which they might repose, or even commence\n  A jurymast or rudder, or could say\nThe ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,\nStill swam—though not exactly like a duck.\n\nThe wind, in fact, perhaps was rather less,\n  But the ship labour'd so, they scarce could hope\nTo weather out much longer; the distress\n  Was also great with which they had to cope\nFor want of water, and their solid mess\n  Was scant enough: in vain the telescope\nWas used—nor sail nor shore appear'd in sight,\nNought but the heavy sea, and coming night.\n\nAgain the weather threaten'd,—again blew\n  A gale, and in the fore and after hold\nWater appear'd; yet, though the people knew\n  All this, the most were patient, and some bold,\nUntil the chains and leathers were worn through\n  Of all our pumps:—a wreck complete she roll'd,\nAt mercy of the waves, whose mercies are\nLike human beings during civil war.\n\nThen came the carpenter, at last, with tears\n  In his rough eyes, and told the captain he\nCould do no more: he was a man in years,\n  And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,\nAnd if he wept at length, they were not fears\n  That made his eyelids as a woman's be,\nBut he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,—\nTwo things for dying people quite bewildering.\n\nThe ship was evidently settling now\n  Fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,\nSome went to prayers again, and made a vow\n  Of candles to their saints—but there were none\nTo pay them with; and some look'd o'er the bow;\n  Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one\nThat begg'd Pedrillo for an absolution,\nWho told him to be damn'd—in his confusion.\n\nSome lash'd them in their hammocks; some put on\n  Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;\nSome cursed the day on which they saw the sun,\n  And gnash'd their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;\nAnd others went on as they had begun,\n  Getting the boats out, being well aware\nThat a tight boat will live in a rough sea,\nUnless with breakers close beneath her lee.\n\nThe worst of all was, that in their condition,\n  Having been several days in great distress,\n'T was difficult to get out such provision\n  As now might render their long suffering less:\nMen, even when dying, dislike inanition;\n  Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:\nTwo casks of biscuit and a keg of butter\nWere all that could be thrown into the cutter.\n\nBut in the long-boat they contrived to stow\n  Some pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;\nWater, a twenty-gallon cask or so;\n  Six flasks of wine; and they contrived to get\nA portion of their beef up from below,\n  And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,\nBut scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon—\nThen there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.\n\nThe other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had\n  Been stove in the beginning of the gale;\nAnd the long-boat's condition was but bad,\n  As there were but two blankets for a sail,\nAnd one oar for a mast, which a young lad\n  Threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;\nAnd two boats could not hold, far less be stored,\nTo save one half the people then on board.\n\n'T was twilight, and the sunless day went down\n  Over the waste of waters; like a veil,\nWhich, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown\n  Of one whose hate is mask'd but to assail,\nThus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,\n  And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,\nAnd the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear\nBeen their familiar, and now Death was here.\n\nSome trial had been making at a raft,\n  With little hope in such a rolling sea,\nA sort of thing at which one would have laugh'd,\n  If any laughter at such times could be,\nUnless with people who too much have quaff'd,\n  And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,\nHalf epileptical and half hysterical:—\nTheir preservation would have been a miracle.\n\nAt half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,\n  And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,\nThat still could keep afloat the struggling tars,\n  For yet they strove, although of no great use:\nThere was no light in heaven but a few stars,\n  The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;\nShe gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,\nAnd, going down head foremost—sunk, in short.\n\nThen rose from sea to sky the wild farewell—\n  Then shriek'd the timid, and stood still the brave,\nThen some leap'd overboard with dreadful yell,\n  As eager to anticipate their grave;\nAnd the sea yawn'd around her like a hell,\n  And down she suck'd with her the whirling wave,\nLike one who grapples with his enemy,\nAnd strives to strangle him before he die.\n\nAnd first one universal shriek there rush'd,\n  Louder than the loud ocean, like a crash\nOf echoing thunder; and then all was hush'd,\n  Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash\nOf billows; but at intervals there gush'd,\n  Accompanied with a convulsive splash,\nA solitary shriek, the bubbling cry\nOf some strong swimmer in his agony.\n\nThe boats, as stated, had got off before,\n  And in them crowded several of the crew;\nAnd yet their present hope was hardly more\n  Than what it had been, for so strong it blew\nThere was slight chance of reaching any shore;\n  And then they were too many, though so few—\nNine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,\nWere counted in them when they got afloat.\n\nAll the rest perish'd; near two hundred souls\n  Had left their bodies; and what 's worse, alas!\nWhen over Catholics the ocean rolls,\n  They must wait several weeks before a mass\nTakes off one peck of purgatorial coals,\n  Because, till people know what 's come to pass,\nThey won't lay out their money on the dead—\nIt costs three francs for every mass that 's said.\n\nJuan got into the long-boat, and there\n  Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place;\nIt seem'd as if they had exchanged their care,\n  For Juan wore the magisterial face\nWhich courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair\n  Of eyes were crying for their owner's case:\nBattista; though (a name call'd shortly Tita),\nWas lost by getting at some aqua-vita.\n\nPedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,\n  But the same cause, conducive to his loss,\nLeft him so drunk, he jump'd into the wave\n  As o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,\nAnd so he found a wine-and-watery grave;\n  They could not rescue him although so close,\nBecause the sea ran higher every minute,\nAnd for the boat—the crew kept crowding in it.\n\nA small old spaniel,—which had been Don Jose's,\n  His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,\nFor on such things the memory reposes\n  With tenderness—stood howling on the brink,\nKnowing (dogs have such intellectual noses!),\n  No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;\nAnd Juan caught him up, and ere he stepp'd\nOff, threw him in, then after him he leap'd.\n\nHe also stuff'd his money where he could\n  About his person, and Pedrillo's too,\nWho let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,\n  Not knowing what himself to say, or do,\nAs every rising wave his dread renew'd;\n  But Juan, trusting they might still get through,\nAnd deeming there were remedies for any ill,\nThus re-embark'd his tutor and his spaniel.\n\n'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,\n  That the sail was becalm'd between the seas,\nThough on the wave's high top too much to set,\n  They dared not take it in for all the breeze:\nEach sea curl'd o'er the stern, and kept them wet,\n  And made them bale without a moment's ease,\nSo that themselves as well as hopes were damp'd,\nAnd the poor little cutter quickly swamp'd.\n\nNine souls more went in her: the long-boat still\n  Kept above water, with an oar for mast,\nTwo blankets stitch'd together, answering ill\n  Instead of sail, were to the oar made fast:\nThough every wave roll'd menacing to fill,\n  And present peril all before surpass'd,\nThey grieved for those who perish'd with the cutter,\nAnd also for the biscuit-casks and butter.\n\nThe sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign\n  Of the continuance of the gale: to run\nBefore the sea until it should grow fine,\n  Was all that for the present could be done:\nA few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine\n  Were served out to the people, who begun\nTo faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,\nAnd most of them had little clothes but rags.\n\nThey counted thirty, crowded in a space\n  Which left scarce room for motion or exertion;\nThey did their best to modify their case,\n  One half sate up, though numb'd with the immersion,\nWhile t'other half were laid down in their place\n  At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian\nAgue in its cold fit, they fill'd their boat,\nWith nothing but the sky for a great coat.\n\n'T is very certain the desire of life\n  Prolongs it: this is obvious to physicians,\nWhen patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,\n  Survive through very desperate conditions,\nBecause they still can hope, nor shines the knife\n  Nor shears of Atropos before their visions:\nDespair of all recovery spoils longevity,\nAnd makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity.\n\n'T is said that persons living on annuities\n  Are longer lived than others,—God knows why,\nUnless to plague the grantors,—yet so true it is,\n  That some, I really think, do never die;\nOf any creditors the worst a Jew it is,\n  And that 's their mode of furnishing supply:\nIn my young days they lent me cash that way,\nWhich I found very troublesome to pay.\n\n'T is thus with people in an open boat,\n  They live upon the love of life, and bear\nMore than can be believed, or even thought,\n  And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;\nAnd hardship still has been the sailor's lot,\n  Since Noah's ark went cruising here and there;\nShe had a curious crew as well as cargo,\nLike the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.\n\nBut man is a carnivorous production,\n  And must have meals, at least one meal a day;\nHe cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,\n  But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;\nAlthough his anatomical construction\n  Bears vegetables, in a grumbling way,\nYour labouring people think beyond all question,\nBeef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.\n\nAnd thus it was with this our hapless crew;\n  For on the third day there came on a calm,\nAnd though at first their strength it might renew,\n  And lying on their weariness like balm,\nLull'd them like turtles sleeping on the blue\n  Of ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,\nAnd fell all ravenously on their provision,\nInstead of hoarding it with due precision.\n\nThe consequence was easily foreseen—\n  They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,\nIn spite of all remonstrances, and then\n  On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?\nThey hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!\n  And carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,\nBut as they had but one oar, and that brittle,\nIt would have been more wise to save their victual.\n\nThe fourth day came, but not a breath of air,\n  And Ocean slumber'd like an unwean'd child:\nThe fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,\n  The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild—\nWith their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)\n  What could they do? and hunger's rage grew wild:\nSo Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,\nWas kill'd and portion'd out for present eating.\n\nOn the sixth day they fed upon his hide,\n  And Juan, who had still refused, because\nThe creature was his father's dog that died,\n  Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,\nWith some remorse received (though first denied)\n  As a great favour one of the fore-paws,\nWhich he divided with Pedrillo, who\nDevour'd it, longing for the other too.\n\nThe seventh day, and no wind—the burning sun\n  Blister'd and scorch'd, and, stagnant on the sea,\nThey lay like carcasses; and hope was none,\n  Save in the breeze that came not; savagely\nThey glared upon each other—all was done,\n  Water, and wine, and food,—and you might see\nThe longings of the cannibal arise\n(Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.\n\nAt length one whisper'd his companion, who\n  Whisper'd another, and thus it went round,\nAnd then into a hoarser murmur grew,\n  An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;\nAnd when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,\n  'T was but his own, suppress'd till now, he found:\nAnd out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,\nAnd who should die to be his fellow's food.\n\nBut ere they came to this, they that day shared\n  Some leathern caps, and what remain'd of shoes;\nAnd then they look'd around them and despair'd,\n  And none to be the sacrifice would choose;\nAt length the lots were torn up, and prepared,\n  But of materials that much shock the Muse—\nHaving no paper, for the want of better,\nThey took by force from Juan Julia's letter.\n\nThe lots were made, and mark'd, and mix'd, and handed,\n  In silent horror, and their distribution\nLull'd even the savage hunger which demanded,\n  Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;\nNone in particular had sought or plann'd it,\n  'T was nature gnaw'd them to this resolution,\nBy which none were permitted to be neuter—\nAnd the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.\n\nHe but requested to be bled to death:\n  The surgeon had his instruments, and bled\nPedrillo, and so gently ebb'd his breath,\n  You hardly could perceive when he was dead.\nHe died as born, a Catholic in faith,\n  Like most in the belief in which they 're bred,\nAnd first a little crucifix he kiss'd,\nAnd then held out his jugular and wrist.\n\nThe surgeon, as there was no other fee,\n  Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;\nBut being thirstiest at the moment, he\n  Preferr'd a draught from the fast-flowing veins:\nPart was divided, part thrown in the sea,\n  And such things as the entrails and the brains\nRegaled two sharks, who follow'd o'er the billow—\nThe sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.\n\nThe sailors ate him, all save three or four,\n  Who were not quite so fond of animal food;\nTo these was added Juan, who, before\n  Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could\nFeel now his appetite increased much more;\n  'T was not to be expected that he should,\nEven in extremity of their disaster,\nDine with them on his pastor and his master.\n\n'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,\n  The consequence was awful in the extreme;\nFor they, who were most ravenous in the act,\n  Went raging mad—Lord! how they did blaspheme!\nAnd foam and roll, with strange convulsions rack'd,\n  Drinking salt water like a mountain-stream,\nTearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,\nAnd, with hyaena-laughter, died despairing.\n\nTheir numbers were much thinn'd by this infliction,\n  And all the rest were thin enough, Heaven knows;\nAnd some of them had lost their recollection,\n  Happier than they who still perceived their woes;\nBut others ponder'd on a new dissection,\n  As if not warn'd sufficiently by those\nWho had already perish'd, suffering madly,\nFor having used their appetites so sadly.\n\nAnd next they thought upon the master's mate,\n  As fattest; but he saved himself, because,\nBesides being much averse from such a fate,\n  There were some other reasons: the first was,\nHe had been rather indisposed of late;\n  And that which chiefly proved his saving clause\nWas a small present made to him at Cadiz,\nBy general subscription of the ladies.\n\nOf poor Pedrillo something still remain'd,\n  But was used sparingly,—some were afraid,\nAnd others still their appetites constrain'd,\n  Or but at times a little supper made;\nAll except Juan, who throughout abstain'd,\n  Chewing a piece of bamboo and some lead:\nAt length they caught two boobies and a noddy,\nAnd then they left off eating the dead body.\n\nAnd if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,\n  Remember Ugolino condescends\nTo eat the head of his arch-enemy\n  The moment after he politely ends\nHis tale: if foes be food in hell, at sea\n  'T is surely fair to dine upon our friends,\nWhen shipwreck's short allowance grows too scanty,\nWithout being much more horrible than Dante.\n\nAnd the same night there fell a shower of rain,\n  For which their mouths gaped, like the cracks of earth\nWhen dried to summer dust; till taught by pain\n  Men really know not what good water 's worth;\nIf you had been in Turkey or in Spain,\n  Or with a famish'd boat's-crew had your berth,\nOr in the desert heard the camel's bell,\nYou 'd wish yourself where Truth is—in a well.\n\nIt pour'd down torrents, but they were no richer\n  Until they found a ragged piece of sheet,\nWhich served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,\n  And when they deem'd its moisture was complete\nThey wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher\n  Might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet\nAs a full pot of porter, to their thinking\nThey ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking.\n\nAnd their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,\n  Suck'd in the moisture, which like nectar stream'd;\nTheir throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,\n  As the rich man's in hell, who vainly scream'd\nTo beg the beggar, who could not rain back\n  A drop of dew, when every drop had seem'd\nTo taste of heaven—If this be true, indeed\nSome Christians have a comfortable creed.\n\nThere were two fathers in this ghastly crew,\n  And with them their two sons, of whom the one\nWas more robust and hardy to the view,\n  But he died early; and when he was gone,\nHis nearest messmate told his sire, who threw\n  One glance at him, and said, 'Heaven's will be done!\nI can do nothing,' and he saw him thrown\nInto the deep without a tear or groan.\n\nThe other father had a weaklier child,\n  Of a soft cheek and aspect delicate;\nBut the boy bore up long, and with a mild\n  And patient spirit held aloof his fate;\nLittle he said, and now and then he smiled,\n  As if to win a part from off the weight\nHe saw increasing on his father's heart,\nWith the deep deadly thought that they must part.\n\nAnd o'er him bent his sire, and never raised\n  His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam\nFrom his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,\n  And when the wish'd-for shower at length was come,\nAnd the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,\n  Brighten'd, and for a moment seem'd to roam,\nHe squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain\nInto his dying child's mouth—but in vain.\n\nThe boy expired—the father held the clay,\n  And look'd upon it long, and when at last\nDeath left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay\n  Stiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,\nHe watch'd it wistfully, until away\n  'T was borne by the rude wave wherein 't was cast;\nThen he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,\nAnd gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.\n\nNow overhead a rainbow, bursting through\n  The scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,\nResting its bright base on the quivering blue;\n  And all within its arch appear'd to be\nClearer than that without, and its wide hue\n  Wax'd broad and waving, like a banner free,\nThen changed like to a bow that 's bent, and then\nForsook the dim eyes of these shipwreck'd men.\n\nIt changed, of course; a heavenly chameleon,\n  The airy child of vapour and the sun,\nBrought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,\n  Baptized in molten gold, and swathed in dun,\nGlittering like crescents o'er a Turk's pavilion,\n  And blending every colour into one,\nJust like a black eye in a recent scuffle\n(For sometimes we must box without the muffle).\n\nOur shipwreck'd seamen thought it a good omen—\n  It is as well to think so, now and then;\n'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,\n  And may become of great advantage when\nFolks are discouraged; and most surely no men\n  Had greater need to nerve themselves again\nThan these, and so this rainbow look'd like hope—\nQuite a celestial kaleidoscope.\n\nAbout this time a beautiful white bird,\n  Webfooted, not unlike a dove in size\nAnd plumage (probably it might have err'd\n  Upon its course), pass'd oft before their eyes,\nAnd tried to perch, although it saw and heard\n  The men within the boat, and in this guise\nIt came and went, and flutter'd round them till\nNight fell: this seem'd a better omen still.\n\nBut in this case I also must remark,\n  'T was well this bird of promise did not perch,\nBecause the tackle of our shatter'd bark\n  Was not so safe for roosting as a church;\nAnd had it been the dove from Noah's ark,\n  Returning there from her successful search,\nWhich in their way that moment chanced to fall,\nThey would have eat her, olive-branch and all.\n\nWith twilight it again came on to blow,\n  But not with violence; the stars shone out,\nThe boat made way; yet now they were so low,\n  They knew not where nor what they were about;\nSome fancied they saw land, and some said 'No!'\n  The frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt—\nSome swore that they heard breakers, others guns,\nAnd all mistook about the latter once.\n\nAs morning broke, the light wind died away,\n  When he who had the watch sung out and swore,\nIf 't was not land that rose with the sun's ray,\n  He wish'd that land he never might see more;\nAnd the rest rubb'd their eyes and saw a bay,\n  Or thought they saw, and shaped their course for shore;\nFor shore it was, and gradually grew\nDistinct, and high, and palpable to view.\n\nAnd then of these some part burst into tears,\n  And others, looking with a stupid stare,\nCould not yet separate their hopes from fears,\n  And seem'd as if they had no further care;\nWhile a few pray'd (the first time for some years)—\n  And at the bottom of the boat three were\nAsleep: they shook them by the hand and head,\nAnd tried to awaken them, but found them dead.\n\nThe day before, fast sleeping on the water,\n  They found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,\nAnd by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,\n  Which yielded a day's life, and to their mind\nProved even still a more nutritious matter,\n  Because it left encouragement behind:\nThey thought that in such perils, more than chance\nHad sent them this for their deliverance.\n\nThe land appear'd a high and rocky coast,\n  And higher grew the mountains as they drew,\nSet by a current, toward it: they were lost\n  In various conjectures, for none knew\nTo what part of the earth they had been tost,\n  So changeable had been the winds that blew;\nSome thought it was Mount AEtna, some the highlands,\nOf Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, or other islands.\n\nMeantime the current, with a rising gale,\n  Still set them onwards to the welcome shore,\nLike Charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:\n  Their living freight was now reduced to four,\nAnd three dead, whom their strength could not avail\n  To heave into the deep with those before,\nThough the two sharks still follow'd them, and dash'd\nThe spray into their faces as they splash'd.\n\nFamine, despair, cold, thirst, and heat, had done\n  Their work on them by turns, and thinn'd them to\nSuch things a mother had not known her son\n  Amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;\nBy night chill'd, by day scorch'd, thus one by one\n  They perish'd, until wither'd to these few,\nBut chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,\nIn washing down Pedrillo with salt water.\n\nAs they drew nigh the land, which now was seen\n  Unequal in its aspect here and there,\nThey felt the freshness of its growing green,\n  That waved in forest-tops, and smooth'd the air,\nAnd fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen\n  From glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare—\nLovely seem'd any object that should sweep\nAway the vast, salt, dread, eternal deep.\n\nThe shore look'd wild, without a trace of man,\n  And girt by formidable waves; but they\nWere mad for land, and thus their course they ran,\n  Though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:\nA reef between them also now began\n  To show its boiling surf and bounding spray,\nBut finding no place for their landing better,\nThey ran the boat for shore,—and overset her.\n\nBut in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,\n  Juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont;\nAnd having learnt to swim in that sweet river,\n  Had often turn'd the art to some account:\nA better swimmer you could scarce see ever,\n  He could, perhaps, have pass'd the Hellespont,\nAs once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)\nLeander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.\n\nSo here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,\n  He buoy'd his boyish limbs, and strove to ply\nWith the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,\n  The beach which lay before him, high and dry:\nThe greatest danger here was from a shark,\n  That carried off his neighbour by the thigh;\nAs for the other two, they could not swim,\nSo nobody arrived on shore but him.\n\nNor yet had he arrived but for the oar,\n  Which, providentially for him, was wash'd\nJust as his feeble arms could strike no more,\n  And the hard wave o'erwhelm'd him as 't was dash'd\nWithin his grasp; he clung to it, and sore\n  The waters beat while he thereto was lash'd;\nAt last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he\nRoll'd on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:\n\nThere, breathless, with his digging nails he clung\n  Fast to the sand, lest the returning wave,\nFrom whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,\n  Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:\nAnd there he lay, full length, where he was flung,\n  Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,\nWith just enough of life to feel its pain,\nAnd deem that it was saved, perhaps in vain.\n\nWith slow and staggering effort he arose,\n  But sunk again upon his bleeding knee\nAnd quivering hand; and then he look'd for those\n  Who long had been his mates upon the sea;\nBut none of them appear'd to share his woes,\n  Save one, a corpse, from out the famish'd three,\nWho died two days before, and now had found\nAn unknown barren beach for burial ground.\n\nAnd as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,\n  And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand\nSwam round and round, and all his senses pass'd:\n  He fell upon his side, and his stretch'd hand\nDroop'd dripping on the oar (their jurymast),\n  And, like a wither'd lily, on the land\nHis slender frame and pallid aspect lay,\nAs fair a thing as e'er was form'd of clay.\n\nHow long in his damp trance young Juan lay\n  He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,\nAnd Time had nothing more of night nor day\n  For his congealing blood, and senses dim;\nAnd how this heavy faintness pass'd away\n  He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,\nAnd tingling vein, seem'd throbbing back to life,\nFor Death, though vanquish'd, still retired with strife.\n\nHis eyes he open'd, shut, again unclosed,\n  For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought\nHe still was in the boat and had but dozed,\n  And felt again with his despair o'erwrought,\nAnd wish'd it death in which he had reposed;\n  And then once more his feelings back were brought,\nAnd slowly by his swimming eyes was seen\nA lovely female face of seventeen.\n\n'T was bending dose o'er his, and the small mouth\n  Seem'd almost prying into his for breath;\nAnd chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth\n  Recall'd his answering spirits back from death;\nAnd, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe\n  Each pulse to animation, till beneath\nIts gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh\nTo these kind efforts made a low reply.\n\nThen was the cordial pour'd, and mantle flung\n  Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm\nRaised higher the faint head which o'er it hung;\n  And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,\nPillow'd his death-like forehead; then she wrung\n  His dewy curls, long drench'd by every storm;\nAnd watch'd with eagerness each throb that drew\nA sigh from his heaved bosom—and hers, too.\n\nAnd lifting him with care into the cave,\n  The gentle girl and her attendant,—one\nYoung, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,\n  And more robust of figure,—then begun\nTo kindle fire, and as the new flames gave\n  Light to the rocks that roof'd them, which the sun\nHad never seen, the maid, or whatsoe'er\nShe was, appear'd distinct, and tall, and fair.\n\nHer brow was overhung with coins of gold,\n  That sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair—\nHer clustering hair, whose longer locks were roll'd\n  In braids behind; and though her stature were\nEven of the highest for a female mould,\n  They nearly reach'd her heel; and in her air\nThere was a something which bespoke command,\nAs one who was a lady in the land.\n\nHer hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes\n  Were black as death, their lashes the same hue,\nOf downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies\n  Deepest attraction; for when to the view\nForth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,\n  Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;\n'T is as the snake late coil'd, who pours his length,\nAnd hurls at once his venom and his strength.\n\nHer brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye\n  Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;\nShort upper lip—sweet lips! that make us sigh\n  Ever to have seen such; for she was one\nFit for the model of a statuary\n  (A race of mere impostors, when all 's done—\nI 've seen much finer women, ripe and real,\nThan all the nonsense of their stone ideal).\n\nI 'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just\n  One should not rail without a decent cause:\nThere was an Irish lady, to whose bust\n  I ne'er saw justice done, and yet she was\nA frequent model; and if e'er she must\n  Yield to stern Time and Nature's wrinkling laws,\nThey will destroy a face which mortal thought\nNe'er compass'd, nor less mortal chisel wrought.\n\nAnd such was she, the lady of the cave:\n  Her dress was very different from the Spanish,\nSimpler, and yet of colours not so grave;\n  For, as you know, the Spanish women banish\nBright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave\n  Around them (what I hope will never vanish)\nThe basquina and the mantilla, they\nSeem at the same time mystical and gay.\n\nBut with our damsel this was not the case:\n  Her dress was many-colour'd, finely spun;\nHer locks curl'd negligently round her face,\n  But through them gold and gems profusely shone:\nHer girdle sparkled, and the richest lace\n  Flow'd in her veil, and many a precious stone\nFlash'd on her little hand; but, what was shocking,\nHer small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.\n\nThe other female's dress was not unlike,\n  But of inferior materials: she\nHad not so many ornaments to strike,\n  Her hair had silver only, bound to be\nHer dowry; and her veil, in form alike,\n  Was coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;\nHer hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes\nAs black, but quicker, and of smaller size.\n\nAnd these two tended him, and cheer'd him both\n  With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,\nWhich are (as I must own) of female growth,\n  And have ten thousand delicate inventions:\nThey made a most superior mess of broth,\n  A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,\nBut the best dish that e'er was cook'd since Homer's\nAchilles ordered dinner for new comers.\n\nI 'll tell you who they were, this female pair,\n  Lest they should seem princesses in disguise;\nBesides, I hate all mystery, and that air\n  Of clap-trap which your recent poets prize;\nAnd so, in short, the girls they really were\n  They shall appear before your curious eyes,\nMistress and maid; the first was only daughter\nOf an old man who lived upon the water.\n\nA fisherman he had been in his youth,\n  And still a sort of fisherman was he;\nBut other speculations were, in sooth,\n  Added to his connection with the sea,\nPerhaps not so respectable, in truth:\n  A little smuggling, and some piracy,\nLeft him, at last, the sole of many masters\nOf an ill-gotten million of piastres.\n\nA fisher, therefore, was he,—though of men,\n  Like Peter the Apostle,—and he fish'd\nFor wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,\n  And sometimes caught as many as he wish'd;\nThe cargoes he confiscated, and gain\n  He sought in the slave-market too, and dish'd\nFull many a morsel for that Turkish trade,\nBy which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.\n\nHe was a Greek, and on his isle had built\n  (One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)\nA very handsome house from out his guilt,\n  And there he lived exceedingly at ease;\nHeaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt,\n  A sad old fellow was he, if you please;\nBut this I know, it was a spacious building,\nFull of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding.\n\nHe had an only daughter, call'd Haidee,\n  The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;\nBesides, so very beautiful was she,\n  Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:\nStill in her teens, and like a lovely tree\n  She grew to womanhood, and between whiles\nRejected several suitors, just to learn\nHow to accept a better in his turn.\n\n![Frontispiece](images/frontispiece.jpg)\n\nAnd walking out upon the beach, below\n  The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,\nInsensible,—not dead, but nearly so,—\n  Don Juan, almost famish'd, and half drown'd;\nBut being naked, she was shock'd, you know,\n  Yet deem'd herself in common pity bound,\nAs far as in her lay, 'to take him in,\nA stranger' dying, with so white a skin.\n\nBut taking him into her father's house\n  Was not exactly the best way to save,\nBut like conveying to the cat the mouse,\n  Or people in a trance into their grave;\nBecause the good old man had so much 'nous,'\n  Unlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,\nHe would have hospitably cured the stranger,\nAnd sold him instantly when out of danger.\n\nAnd therefore, with her maid, she thought it best\n  (A virgin always on her maid relies)\nTo place him in the cave for present rest:\n  And when, at last, he open'd his black eyes,\nTheir charity increased about their guest;\n  And their compassion grew to such a size,\nIt open'd half the turnpike-gates to heaven\n(St. Paul says, 't is the toll which must be given).\n\nThey made a fire,—but such a fire as they\n  Upon the moment could contrive with such\nMaterials as were cast up round the bay,—\n  Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch\nWere nearly tinder, since so long they lay\n  A mast was almost crumbled to a crutch;\nBut, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,\nThat there was fuel to have furnish'd twenty.\n\nHe had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,\n  For Haidee stripped her sables off to make\nHis couch; and, that he might be more at ease,\n  And warm, in case by chance he should awake,\nThey also gave a petticoat apiece,\n  She and her maid—and promised by daybreak\nTo pay him a fresh visit, with a dish\nFor breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish.\n\nAnd thus they left him to his lone repose:\n  Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,\nWho sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),\n  Just for the present; and in his lull'd head\nNot even a vision of his former woes\n  Throbb'd in accursed dreams, which sometimes spread\nUnwelcome visions of our former years,\nTill the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.\n\nYoung Juan slept all dreamless:—but the maid,\n  Who smooth'd his pillow, as she left the den\nLook'd back upon him, and a moment stay'd,\n  And turn'd, believing that he call'd again.\nHe slumber'd; yet she thought, at least she said\n  (The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),\nHe had pronounced her name—but she forgot\nThat at this moment Juan knew it not.\n\nAnd pensive to her father's house she went,\n  Enjoining silence strict to Zoe, who\nBetter than her knew what, in fact, she meant,\n  She being wiser by a year or two:\nA year or two 's an age when rightly spent,\n  And Zoe spent hers, as most women do,\nIn gaining all that useful sort of knowledge\nWhich is acquired in Nature's good old college.\n\nThe morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still\n  Fast in his cave, and nothing clash'd upon\nHis rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,\n  And the young beams of the excluded sun,\nTroubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;\n  And need he had of slumber yet, for none\nHad suffer'd more—his hardships were comparative\nTo those related in my grand-dad's 'Narrative.'\n\nNot so Haidee: she sadly toss'd and tumbled,\n  And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er\nDream'd of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,\n  And handsome corpses strew'd upon the shore;\nAnd woke her maid so early that she grumbled,\n  And call'd her father's old slaves up, who swore\nIn several oaths—Armenian, Turk, and Greek—\nThey knew not what to think of such a freak.\n\nBut up she got, and up she made them get,\n  With some pretence about the sun, that makes\nSweet skies just when he rises, or is set;\n  And 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks\nBright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet\n  With mist, and every bird with him awakes,\nAnd night is flung off like a mourning suit\nWorn for a husband,—or some other brute.\n\nI say, the sun is a most glorious sight,\n  I 've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late\nI have sat up on purpose all the night,\n  Which hastens, as physicians say, one's fate;\nAnd so all ye, who would be in the right\n  In health and purse, begin your day to date\nFrom daybreak, and when coffin'd at fourscore,\nEngrave upon the plate, you rose at four.\n\nAnd Haidee met the morning face to face;\n  Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush\nHad dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race\n  From heart to cheek is curb'd into a blush,\nLike to a torrent which a mountain's base,\n  That overpowers some Alpine river's rush,\nChecks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;\nOr the Red Sea—but the sea is not red.\n\nAnd down the cliff the island virgin came,\n  And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,\nWhile the sun smiled on her with his first flame,\n  And young Aurora kiss'd her lips with dew,\nTaking her for a sister; just the same\n  Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,\nAlthough the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,\nHad all the advantage, too, of not being air.\n\nAnd when into the cavern Haidee stepp'd\n  All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw\nThat like an infant Juan sweetly slept;\n  And then she stopp'd, and stood as if in awe\n(For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept\n  And wrapt him closer, lest the air, too raw,\nShould reach his blood, then o'er him still as death\nBent with hush'd lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.\n\nAnd thus like to an angel o'er the dying\n  Who die in righteousness, she lean'd; and there\nAll tranquilly the shipwreck'd boy was lying,\n  As o'er him the calm and stirless air:\nBut Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,\n  Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair\nMust breakfast—and betimes, lest they should ask it,\nShe drew out her provision from the basket.\n\nShe knew that the best feelings must have victual,\n  And that a shipwreck'd youth would hungry be;\nBesides, being less in love, she yawn'd a little,\n  And felt her veins chill'd by the neighbouring sea;\nAnd so, she cook'd their breakfast to a tittle;\n  I can't say that she gave them any tea,\nBut there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,\nWith Scio wine,—and all for love, not money.\n\nAnd Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and\n  The coffee made, would fain have waken'd Juan;\nBut Haidee stopp'd her with her quick small hand,\n  And without word, a sign her finger drew on\nHer lip, which Zoe needs must understand;\n  And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,\nBecause her mistress would not let her break\nThat sleep which seem'd as it would ne'er awake.\n\nFor still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek\n  A purple hectic play'd like dying day\nOn the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak\n  Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,\nWhere the blue veins look'd shadowy, shrunk, and weak;\n  And his black curls were dewy with the spray,\nWhich weigh'd upon them yet, all damp and salt,\nMix'd with the stony vapours of the vault.\n\nAnd she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,\n  Hush'd as the babe upon its mother's breast,\nDroop'd as the willow when no winds can breathe,\n  Lull'd like the depth of ocean when at rest,\nFair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,\n  Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;\nIn short, he was a very pretty fellow,\nAlthough his woes had turn'd him rather yellow.\n\nHe woke and gazed, and would have slept again,\n  But the fair face which met his eyes forbade\nThose eyes to close, though weariness and pain\n  Had further sleep a further pleasure made;\nFor woman's face was never form'd in vain\n  For Juan, so that even when he pray'd\nHe turn'd from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,\nTo the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.\n\nAnd thus upon his elbow he arose,\n  And look'd upon the lady, in whose cheek\nThe pale contended with the purple rose,\n  As with an effort she began to speak;\nHer eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,\n  Although she told him, in good modern Greek,\nWith an Ionian accent, low and sweet,\nThat he was faint, and must not talk, but eat.\n\nNow Juan could not understand a word,\n  Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,\nAnd her voice was the warble of a bird,\n  So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,\nThat finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;\n  The sort of sound we echo with a tear,\nWithout knowing why—an overpowering tone,\nWhence Melody descends as from a throne.\n\nAnd Juan gazed as one who is awoke\n  By a distant organ, doubting if he be\nNot yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke\n  By the watchman, or some such reality,\nOr by one's early valet's cursed knock;\n  At least it is a heavy sound to me,\nWho like a morning slumber—for the night\nShows stars and women in a better light.\n\nAnd Juan, too, was help'd out from his dream,\n  Or sleep, or whatso'er it was, by feeling\nA most prodigious appetite: the steam\n  Of Zoe's cookery no doubt was stealing\nUpon his senses, and the kindling beam\n  Of the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling\nTo stir her viands, made him quite awake\nAnd long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.\n\nBut beef is rare within these oxless isles;\n  Goat's flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton;\nAnd, when a holiday upon them smiles,\n  A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:\nBut this occurs but seldom, between whiles,\n  For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;\nOthers are fair and fertile, among which\nThis, though not large, was one of the most rich.\n\nI say that beef is rare, and can't help thinking\n  That the old fable of the Minotaur—\nFrom which our modern morals rightly shrinking\n  Condemn the royal lady's taste who wore\nA cow's shape for a mask—was only (sinking\n  The allegory) a mere type, no more,\nThat Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,\nTo make the Cretans bloodier in battle.\n\nFor we all know that English people are\n  Fed upon beef—I won't say much of beer,\nBecause 't is liquor only, and being far\n  From this my subject, has no business here;\nWe know, too, they very fond of war,\n  A pleasure—like all pleasures—rather dear;\nSo were the Cretans—from which I infer\nThat beef and battles both were owing to her.\n\nBut to resume. The languid Juan raised\n  His head upon his elbow, and he saw\nA sight on which he had not lately gazed,\n  As all his latter meals had been quite raw,\nThree or four things, for which the Lord he praised,\n  And, feeling still the famish'd vulture gnaw,\nHe fell upon whate'er was offer'd, like\nA priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.\n\nHe ate, and he was well supplied: and she,\n  Who watch'd him like a mother, would have fed\nHim past all bounds, because she smiled to see\n  Such appetite in one she had deem'd dead;\nBut Zoe, being older than Haidee,\n  Knew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)\nThat famish'd people must be slowly nurst,\nAnd fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.\n\nAnd so she took the liberty to state,\n  Rather by deeds than words, because the case\nWas urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate\n  Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace\nThe sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,\n  Unless he wish'd to die upon the place—\nShe snatch'd it, and refused another morsel,\nSaying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill.\n\nNext they—he being naked, save a tatter'd\n  Pair of scarce decent trowsers—went to work,\nAnd in the fire his recent rags they scatter'd,\n  And dress'd him, for the present, like a Turk,\nOr Greek—that is, although it not much matter'd,\n  Omitting turban, slippers, pistols, dirk,—\nThey furnish'd him, entire, except some stitches,\nWith a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches.\n\nAnd then fair Haidee tried her tongue at speaking,\n  But not a word could Juan comprehend,\nAlthough he listen'd so that the young Greek in\n  Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;\nAnd, as he interrupted not, went eking\n  Her speech out to her protege and friend,\nTill pausing at the last her breath to take,\nShe saw he did not understand Romaic.\n\nAnd then she had recourse to nods, and signs,\n  And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,\nAnd read (the only book she could) the lines\n  Of his fair face, and found, by sympathy,\nThe answer eloquent, where soul shines\n  And darts in one quick glance a long reply;\nAnd thus in every look she saw exprest\nA world of words, and things at which she guess'd.\n\nAnd now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,\n  And words repeated after her, he took\nA lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,\n  No doubt, less of her language than her look:\nAs he who studies fervently the skies\n  Turns oftener to the stars than to his book,\nThus Juan learn'd his alpha beta better\nFrom Haidee's glance than any graven letter.\n\n'T is pleasing to be school'd in a strange tongue\n  By female lips and eyes—that is, I mean,\nWhen both the teacher and the taught are young,\n  As was the case, at least, where I have been;\nThey smile so when one 's right, and when one 's wrong\n  They smile still more, and then there intervene\nPressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;—\nI learn'd the little that I know by this:\n\nThat is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,\n  Italian not at all, having no teachers;\nMuch English I cannot pretend to speak,\n  Learning that language chiefly from its preachers,\nBarrow, South, Tillotson, whom every week\n  I study, also Blair, the highest reachers\nOf eloquence in piety and prose—\nI hate your poets, so read none of those.\n\nAs for the ladies, I have nought to say,\n  A wanderer from the British world of fashion,\nWhere I, like other 'dogs, have had my day,'\n  Like other men, too, may have had my passion—\nBut that, like other things, has pass'd away,\n  And all her fools whom I could lay the lash on:\nFoes, friends, men, women, now are nought to me\nBut dreams of what has been, no more to be.\n\nReturn we to Don Juan. He begun\n  To hear new words, and to repeat them; but\nSome feelings, universal as the sun,\n  Were such as could not in his breast be shut\nMore than within the bosom of a nun:\n  He was in love,—as you would be, no doubt,\nWith a young benefactress,—so was she,\nJust in the way we very often see.\n\nAnd every day by daybreak—rather early\n  For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest—\nShe came into the cave, but it was merely\n  To see her bird reposing in his nest;\nAnd she would softly stir his locks so curly,\n  Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,\nBreathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,\nAs o'er a bed of roses the sweet south.\n\nAnd every morn his colour freshlier came,\n  And every day help'd on his convalescence;\n'T was well, because health in the human frame\n  Is pleasant, besides being true love's essence,\nFor health and idleness to passion's flame\n  Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons\nAre also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,\nWithout whom Venus will not long attack us.\n\nWhile Venus fills the heart (without heart really\n  Love, though good always, is not quite so good),\nCeres presents a plate of vermicelli,—\n  For love must be sustain'd like flesh and blood,—\nWhile Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:\n  Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;\nBut who is their purveyor from above\nHeaven knows,—it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.\n\nWhen Juan woke he found some good things ready,\n  A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes\nThat ever made a youthful heart less steady,\n  Besides her maid's as pretty for their size;\nBut I have spoken of all this already—\n  And repetition 's tiresome and unwise,—\nWell—Juan, after bathing in the sea,\nCame always back to coffee and Haidee.\n\nBoth were so young, and one so innocent,\n  That bathing pass'd for nothing; Juan seem'd\nTo her, as 'twere, the kind of being sent,\n  Of whom these two years she had nightly dream'd,\nA something to be loved, a creature meant\n  To be her happiness, and whom she deem'd\nTo render happy; all who joy would win\nMust share it,—Happiness was born a twin.\n\nIt was such pleasure to behold him, such\n  Enlargement of existence to partake\nNature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,\n  To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:\nTo live with him forever were too much;\n  But then the thought of parting made her quake;\nHe was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast\nLike a rich wreck—her first love, and her last.\n\nAnd thus a moon roll'd on, and fair Haidee\n  Paid daily visits to her boy, and took\nSuch plentiful precautions, that still he\n  Remain'd unknown within his craggy nook;\nAt last her father's prows put out to sea\n  For certain merchantmen upon the look,\nNot as of yore to carry off an Io,\nBut three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.\n\nThen came her freedom, for she had no mother,\n  So that, her father being at sea, she was\nFree as a married woman, or such other\n  Female, as where she likes may freely pass,\nWithout even the incumbrance of a brother,\n  The freest she that ever gazed on glass;\nI speak of Christian lands in this comparison,\nWhere wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.\n\nNow she prolong'd her visits and her talk\n  (For they must talk), and he had learnt to say\nSo much as to propose to take a walk,—\n  For little had he wander'd since the day\nOn which, like a young flower snapp'd from the stalk,\n  Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,—\nAnd thus they walk'd out in the afternoon,\nAnd saw the sun set opposite the moon.\n\nIt was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,\n  With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,\nGuarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,\n  With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore\nA better welcome to the tempest-tost;\n  And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,\nSave on the dead long summer days, which make\nThe outstretch'd ocean glitter like a lake.\n\nAnd the small ripple spilt upon the beach\n  Scarcely o'erpass'd the cream of your champagne,\nWhen o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,\n  That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!\nFew things surpass old wine; and they may preach\n  Who please,—the more because they preach in vain,—\nLet us have wine and women, mirth and laughter,\nSermons and soda-water the day after.\n\nMan, being reasonable, must get drunk;\n  The best of life is but intoxication:\nGlory, the grape, love, gold, in these are sunk\n  The hopes of all men, and of every nation;\nWithout their sap, how branchless were the trunk\n  Of life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion:\nBut to return,—Get very drunk; and when\nYou wake with headache, you shall see what then.\n\nRing for your valet—bid him quickly bring\n  Some hock and soda-water, then you 'll know\nA pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;\n  For not the bless'd sherbet, sublimed with snow,\nNor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,\n  Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,\nAfter long travel, ennui, love, or slaughter,\nVie with that draught of hock and soda-water.\n\nThe coast—I think it was the coast that\n  Was just describing—Yes, it was the coast—\nLay at this period quiet as the sky,\n  The sands untumbled, the blue waves untost,\nAnd all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,\n  And dolphin's leap, and little billow crost\nBy some low rock or shelve, that made it fret\nAgainst the boundary it scarcely wet.\n\nAnd forth they wander'd, her sire being gone,\n  As I have said, upon an expedition;\nAnd mother, brother, guardian, she had none,\n  Save Zoe, who, although with due precision\nShe waited on her lady with the sun,\n  Thought daily service was her only mission,\nBringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,\nAnd asking now and then for cast-off dresses.\n\nIt was the cooling hour, just when the rounded\n  Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,\nWhich then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,\n  Circling all nature, hush'd, and dim, and still,\nWith the far mountain-crescent half surrounded\n  On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill\nUpon the other, and the rosy sky,\nWith one star sparkling through it like an eye.\n\nAnd thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,\n  Over the shining pebbles and the shells,\nGlided along the smooth and harden'd sand,\n  And in the worn and wild receptacles\nWork'd by the storms, yet work'd as it were plann'd,\n  In hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,\nThey turn'd to rest; and, each clasp'd by an arm,\nYielded to the deep twilight's purple charm.\n\nThey look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow\n  Spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;\nThey gazed upon the glittering sea below,\n  Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;\nThey heard the wave's splash, and the wind so low,\n  And saw each other's dark eyes darting light\nInto each other—and, beholding this,\nTheir lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;\n\nA long, long kiss, a kiss of youth, and love,\n  And beauty, all concentrating like rays\nInto one focus, kindled from above;\n  Such kisses as belong to early days,\nWhere heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move,\n  And the blood 's lava, and the pulse a blaze,\nEach kiss a heart-quake,—for a kiss's strength,\nI think, it must be reckon'd by its length.\n\nBy length I mean duration; theirs endured\n  Heaven knows how long—no doubt they never reckon'd;\nAnd if they had, they could not have secured\n  The sum of their sensations to a second:\nThey had not spoken; but they felt allured,\n  As if their souls and lips each other beckon'd,\nWhich, being join'd, like swarming bees they clung—\nTheir hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.\n\nThey were alone, but not alone as they\n  Who shut in chambers think it loneliness;\nThe silent ocean, and the starlight bay,\n  The twilight glow which momently grew less,\nThe voiceless sands and dropping caves, that lay\n  Around them, made them to each other press,\nAs if there were no life beneath the sky\nSave theirs, and that their life could never die.\n\nThey fear'd no eyes nor ears on that lone beach,\n  They felt no terrors from the night, they were\nAll in all to each other: though their speech\n  Was broken words, they thought a language there,—\nAnd all the burning tongues the passions teach\n  Found in one sigh the best interpreter\nOf nature's oracle—first love,—that all\nWhich Eve has left her daughters since her fall.\n\nHaidde spoke not of scruples, ask'd no vows,\n  Nor offer'd any; she had never heard\nOf plight and promises to be a spouse,\n  Or perils by a loving maid incurr'd;\nShe was all which pure ignorance allows,\n  And flew to her young mate like a young bird;\nAnd, never having dreamt of falsehood, she\nHad not one word to say of constancy.\n\nShe loved, and was beloved—she adored,\n  And she was worshipp'd; after nature's fashion,\nTheir intense souls, into each other pour'd,\n  If souls could die, had perish'd in that passion,—\nBut by degrees their senses were restored,\n  Again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;\nAnd, beating 'gainst his bosom, Haidee's heart\nFelt as if never more to beat apart.\n\nAlas! they were so young, so beautiful,\n  So lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour\nWas that in which the heart is always full,\n  And, having o'er itself no further power,\nPrompts deeds eternity can not annul,\n  But pays off moments in an endless shower\nOf hell-fire—all prepared for people giving\nPleasure or pain to one another living.\n\nAlas! for Juan and Haidee! they were\n  So loving and so lovely—till then never,\nExcepting our first parents, such a pair\n  Had run the risk of being damn'd for ever;\nAnd Haidee, being devout as well as fair,\n  Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,\nAnd hell and purgatory—but forgot\nJust in the very crisis she should not.\n\nThey look upon each other, and their eyes\n  Gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps\nRound Juan's head, and his around her lies\n  Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;\nShe sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,\n  He hers, until they end in broken gasps;\nAnd thus they form a group that 's quite antique,\nHalf naked, loving, natural, and Greek.\n\nAnd when those deep and burning moments pass'd,\n  And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,\nShe slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,\n  Sustain'd his head upon her bosom's charms;\nAnd now and then her eye to heaven is cast,\n  And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,\nPillow'd on her o'erflowing heart, which pants\nWith all it granted, and with all it grants.\n\nAn infant when it gazes on a light,\n  A child the moment when it drains the breast,\nA devotee when soars the Host in sight,\n  An Arab with a stranger for a guest,\nA sailor when the prize has struck in fight,\n  A miser filling his most hoarded chest,\nFeel rapture; but not such true joy are reaping\nAs they who watch o'er what they love while sleeping.\n\nFor there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,\n  All that it hath of life with us is living;\nSo gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,\n  And all unconscious of the joy 't is giving;\nAll it hath felt, inflicted, pass'd, and proved,\n  Hush'd into depths beyond the watcher's diving:\nThere lies the thing we love with all its errors\nAnd all its charms, like death without its terrors.\n\nThe lady watch'd her lover—and that hour\n  Of Love's, and Night's, and Ocean's solitude,\nO'erflow'd her soul with their united power;\n  Amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude\nShe and her wave-worn love had made their bower,\n  Where nought upon their passion could intrude,\nAnd all the stars that crowded the blue space\nSaw nothing happier than her glowing face.\n\nAlas! the love of women! it is known\n  To be a lovely and a fearful thing;\nFor all of theirs upon that die is thrown,\n  And if 't is lost, life hath no more to bring\nTo them but mockeries of the past alone,\n  And their revenge is as the tiger's spring,\nDeadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real\nTorture is theirs, what they inflict they feel.\n\nThey are right; for man, to man so oft unjust,\n  Is always so to women; one sole bond\nAwaits them, treachery is all their trust;\n  Taught to conceal, their bursting hearts despond\nOver their idol, till some wealthier lust\n  Buys them in marriage—and what rests beyond?\nA thankless husband, next a faithless lover,\nThen dressing, nursing, praying, and all 's over.\n\nSome take a lover, some take drams or prayers,\n  Some mind their household, others dissipation,\nSome run away, and but exchange their cares,\n  Losing the advantage of a virtuous station;\nFew changes e'er can better their affairs,\n  Theirs being an unnatural situation,\nFrom the dull palace to the dirty hovel:\nSome play the devil, and then write a novel.\n\nHaidee was Nature's bride, and knew not this;\n  Haidee was Passion's child, born where the sun\nShowers triple light, and scorches even the kiss\n  Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one\nMade but to love, to feel that she was his\n  Who was her chosen: what was said or done\nElsewhere was nothing. She had naught to fear,\nHope, care, nor love, beyond, her heart beat here.\n\nAnd oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!\n  How much it costs us! yet each rising throb\nIs in its cause as its effect so sweet,\n  That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob\nJoy of its alchymy, and to repeat\n  Fine truths; even Conscience, too, has a tough job\nTo make us understand each good old maxim,\nSo good—I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.\n\nAnd now 't was done—on the lone shore were plighted\n  Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed\nBeauty upon the beautiful they lighted:\n  Ocean their witness, and the cave their bed,\nBy their own feelings hallow'd and united,\n  Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:\nAnd they were happy, for to their young eyes\nEach was an angel, and earth paradise.\n\nO, Love! of whom great Caesar was the suitor,\n  Titus the master, Antony the slave,\nHorace, Catullus, scholars, Ovid tutor,\n  Sappho the sage blue-stocking, in whose grave\nAll those may leap who rather would be neuter\n  (Leucadia's rock still overlooks the wave)—\nO, Love! thou art the very god of evil,\nFor, after all, we cannot call thee devil.\n\nThou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,\n  And jestest with the brows of mightiest men:\nCaesar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,\n  Have much employ'd the muse of history's pen;\nTheir lives and fortunes were extremely various,\n  Such worthies Time will never see again;\nYet to these four in three things the same luck holds,\nThey all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.\n\nThou mak'st philosophers; there 's Epicurus\n  And Aristippus, a material crew!\nWho to immoral courses would allure us\n  By theories quite practicable too;\nIf only from the devil they would insure us,\n  How pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),\n'Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?'\nSo said the royal sage Sardanapalus.\n\nBut Juan! had he quite forgotten Julia?\n  And should he have forgotten her so soon?\nI can't but say it seems to me most truly\n  Perplexing question; but, no doubt, the moon\nDoes these things for us, and whenever newly\n  Strong palpitation rises, 't is her boon,\nElse how the devil is it that fresh features\nHave such a charm for us poor human creatures?\n\nI hate inconstancy—I loathe, detest,\n  Abhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made\nOf such quicksilver clay that in his breast\n  No permanent foundation can be laid;\nLove, constant love, has been my constant guest,\n  And yet last night, being at a masquerade,\nI saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,\nWhich gave me some sensations like a villain.\n\nBut soon Philosophy came to my aid,\n  And whisper'd, 'Think of every sacred tie!'\n'I will, my dear Philosophy!' I said,\n  'But then her teeth, and then, oh, Heaven! her eye!\nI'll just inquire if she be wife or maid,\n  Or neither—out of curiosity.'\n'Stop!' cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian\n(Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian);\n\n'Stop!' so I stopp'd.—But to return: that which\n  Men call inconstancy is nothing more\nThan admiration due where nature's rich\n  Profusion with young beauty covers o'er\nSome favour'd object; and as in the niche\n  A lovely statue we almost adore,\nThis sort of adoration of the real\nIs but a heightening of the 'beau ideal.'\n\n'T is the perception of the beautiful,\n  A fine extension of the faculties,\nPlatonic, universal, wonderful,\n  Drawn from the stars, and filter'd through the skies,\nWithout which life would be extremely dull;\n  In short, it is the use of our own eyes,\nWith one or two small senses added, just\nTo hint that flesh is form'd of fiery dust.\n\nYet 't is a painful feeling, and unwilling,\n  For surely if we always could perceive\nIn the same object graces quite as killing\n  As when she rose upon us like an Eve,\n'T would save us many a heartache, many a shilling\n  (For we must get them any how or grieve),\nWhereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,\nHow pleasant for the heart as well as liver!\n\nThe heart is like the sky, a part of heaven,\n  But changes night and day, too, like the sky;\nNow o'er it clouds and thunder must be driven,\n  And darkness and destruction as on high:\nBut when it hath been scorch'd, and pierced, and riven,\n  Its storms expire in water-drops; the eye\nPours forth at last the heart's blood turn'd to tears,\nWhich make the English climate of our years.\n\nThe liver is the lazaret of bile,\n  But very rarely executes its function,\nFor the first passion stays there such a while,\n  That all the rest creep in and form a junction,\nLife knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil,—\n  Rage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction,—\nSo that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,\nLike earthquakes from the hidden fire call'd 'central,'\n\nIn the mean time, without proceeding more\n  In this anatomy, I 've finish'd now\nTwo hundred and odd stanzas as before,\n  That being about the number I 'll allow\nEach canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;\n  And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,\nLeaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead\nFor them and theirs with all who deign to read.</code>"

    "innerHtml": "<code>Hail, Muse! et cetera.—We left Juan sleeping,\n  Pillow'd upon a fair and happy breast,\nAnd watch'd by eyes that never yet knew weeping,\n  And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest\nTo feel the poison through her spirit creeping,\n  Or know who rested there, a foe to rest,\nHad soil'd the current of her sinless years,\nAnd turn'd her pure heart's purest blood to tears!\n\nO, Love! what is it in this world of ours\n  Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah, why\nWith cypress branches hast thou Wreathed thy bowers,\n  And made thy best interpreter a sigh?\nAs those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,\n  And place them on their breast—but place to die—\nThus the frail beings we would fondly cherish\nAre laid within our bosoms but to perish.\n\nIn her first passion woman loves her lover,\n  In all the others all she loves is love,\nWhich grows a habit she can ne'er get over,\n  And fits her loosely—like an easy glove,\nAs you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:\n  One man alone at first her heart can move;\nShe then prefers him in the plural number,\nNot finding that the additions much encumber.\n\nI know not if the fault be men's or theirs;\n  But one thing 's pretty sure; a woman planted\n(Unless at once she plunge for life in prayers)\n  After a decent time must be gallanted;\nAlthough, no doubt, her first of love affairs\n  Is that to which her heart is wholly granted;\nYet there are some, they say, who have had none,\nBut those who have ne'er end with only one.\n\n'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign\n  Of human frailty, folly, also crime,\nThat love and marriage rarely can combine,\n  Although they both are born in the same clime;\nMarriage from love, like vinegar from wine—\n  A sad, sour, sober beverage—by time\nIs sharpen'd from its high celestial flavour\nDown to a very homely household savour.\n\nThere 's something of antipathy, as 't were,\n  Between their present and their future state;\nA kind of flattery that 's hardly fair\n  Is used until the truth arrives too late—\nYet what can people do, except despair?\n  The same things change their names at such a rate;\nFor instance—passion in a lover 's glorious,\nBut in a husband is pronounced uxorious.\n\nMen grow ashamed of being so very fond;\n  They sometimes also get a little tired\n(But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:\n  The same things cannot always be admired,\nYet 't is 'so nominated in the bond,'\n  That both are tied till one shall have expired.\nSad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning\nOur days, and put one's servants into mourning.\n\nThere 's doubtless something in domestic doings\n  Which forms, in fact, true love's antithesis;\nRomances paint at full length people's wooings,\n  But only give a bust of marriages;\nFor no one cares for matrimonial cooings,\n  There 's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:\nThink you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,\nHe would have written sonnets all his life?\n\nAll tragedies are finish'd by a death,\n  All comedies are ended by a marriage;\nThe future states of both are left to faith,\n  For authors fear description might disparage\nThe worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,\n  And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;\nSo leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready,\nThey say no more of Death or of the Lady.\n\nThe only two that in my recollection\n  Have sung of heaven and hell, or marriage, are\nDante and Milton, and of both the affection\n  Was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar\nOf fault or temper ruin'd the connection\n  (Such things, in fact, it don't ask much to mar):\nBut Dante's Beatrice and Milton's Eve\nWere not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.\n\nSome persons say that Dante meant theology\n  By Beatrice, and not a mistress—I,\nAlthough my opinion may require apology,\n  Deem this a commentator's fantasy,\nUnless indeed it was from his own knowledge he\n  Decided thus, and show'd good reason why;\nI think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics\nMeant to personify the mathematics.\n\nHaidee and Juan were not married, but\n  The fault was theirs, not mine; it is not fair,\nChaste reader, then, in any way to put\n  The blame on me, unless you wish they were;\nThen if you 'd have them wedded, please to shut\n  The book which treats of this erroneous pair,\nBefore the consequences grow too awful;\n'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful.\n\nYet they were happy,—happy in the illicit\n  Indulgence of their innocent desires;\nBut more imprudent grown with every visit,\n  Haidee forgot the island was her sire's;\nWhen we have what we like, 't is hard to miss it,\n  At least in the beginning, ere one tires;\nThus she came often, not a moment losing,\nWhilst her piratical papa was cruising.\n\nLet not his mode of raising cash seem strange,\n  Although he fleeced the flags of every nation,\nFor into a prime minister but change\n  His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;\nBut he, more modest, took an humbler range\n  Of life, and in an honester vocation\nPursued o'er the high seas his watery journey,\nAnd merely practised as a sea-attorney.\n\nThe good old gentleman had been detain'd\n  By winds and waves, and some important captures;\nAnd, in the hope of more, at sea remain'd,\n  Although a squall or two had damp'd his raptures,\nBy swamping one of the prizes; he had chain'd\n  His prisoners, dividing them like chapters\nIn number'd lots; they all had cuffs and collars,\nAnd averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.\n\nSome he disposed of off Cape Matapan,\n  Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold\nTo his Tunis correspondents, save one man\n  Toss'd overboard unsaleable (being old);\nThe rest—save here and there some richer one,\n  Reserved for future ransom—in the hold\nWere link'd alike, as for the common people he\nHad a large order from the Dey of Tripoli.\n\nThe merchandise was served in the same way,\n  Pieced out for different marts in the Levant;\nExcept some certain portions of the prey,\n  Light classic articles of female want,\nFrench stuffs, lace, tweezers, toothpicks, teapot, tray,\n  Guitars and castanets from Alicant,\nAll which selected from the spoil he gathers,\nRobb'd for his daughter by the best of fathers.\n\nA monkey, a Dutch mastiff, a mackaw,\n  Two parrots, with a Persian cat and kittens,\nHe chose from several animals he saw—\n  A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton's,\nWho dying on the coast of Ithaca,\n  The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance;\nThese to secure in this strong blowing weather,\nHe caged in one huge hamper altogether.\n\nThen having settled his marine affairs,\n  Despatching single cruisers here and there,\nHis vessel having need of some repairs,\n  He shaped his course to where his daughter fair\nContinued still her hospitable cares;\n  But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,\nAnd rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,\nHis port lay on the other side o' the isle.\n\nAnd there he went ashore without delay,\n  Having no custom-house nor quarantine\nTo ask him awkward questions on the way\n  About the time and place where he had been:\nHe left his ship to be hove down next day,\n  With orders to the people to careen;\nSo that all hands were busy beyond measure,\nIn getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure.\n\nArriving at the summit of a hill\n  Which overlook'd the white walls of his home,\nHe stopp'd.—What singular emotions fill\n  Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!\nWith fluttering doubts if all be well or ill—\n  With love for many, and with fears for some;\nAll feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,\nAnd bring our hearts back to their starting-post.\n\nThe approach of home to husbands and to sires,\n  After long travelling by land or water,\nMost naturally some small doubt inspires—\n  A female family 's a serious matter\n(None trusts the sex more, or so much admires—\n  But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);\nWives in their husbands' absences grow subtler,\nAnd daughters sometimes run off with the butler.\n\nAn honest gentleman at his return\n  May not have the good fortune of Ulysses;\nNot all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,\n  Or show the same dislike to suitors' kisses;\nThe odds are that he finds a handsome urn\n  To his memory—and two or three young misses\nBorn to some friend, who holds his wife and riches,—\nAnd that his Argus—bites him by the breeches.\n\nIf single, probably his plighted fair\n  Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;\nBut all the better, for the happy pair\n  May quarrel, and the lady growing wiser,\nHe may resume his amatory care\n  As cavalier servente, or despise her;\nAnd that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,\nWrite odes on the Inconstancy of Woman.\n\nAnd oh! ye gentlemen who have already\n  Some chaste liaison of the kind—I mean\nAn honest friendship with a married lady—\n  The only thing of this sort ever seen\nTo last—of all connections the most steady,\n  And the true Hymen (the first 's but a screen)—\nYet for all that keep not too long away,\nI 've known the absent wrong'd four times a day.\n\nLambro, our sea-solicitor, who had\n  Much less experience of dry land than ocean,\nOn seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;\n  But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion\nOf the true reason of his not being sad,\n  Or that of any other strong emotion;\nHe loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,\nBut knew the cause no more than a philosopher.\n\nHe saw his white walls shining in the sun,\n  His garden trees all shadowy and green;\nHe heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,\n  The distant dog-bark; and perceived between\nThe umbrage of the wood so cool and dun\n  The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen\nOf arms (in the East all arm)—and various dyes\nOf colour'd garbs, as bright as butterflies.\n\nAnd as the spot where they appear he nears,\n  Surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,\nHe hears—alas! no music of the spheres,\n  But an unhallow'd, earthly sound of fiddling!\nA melody which made him doubt his ears,\n  The cause being past his guessing or unriddling;\nA pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after,\nA most unoriental roar of laughter.\n\nAnd still more nearly to the place advancing,\n  Descending rather quickly the declivity,\nThrough the waved branches o'er the greensward glancing,\n  'Midst other indications of festivity,\nSeeing a troop of his domestics dancing\n  Like dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he\nPerceived it was the Pyrrhic dance so martial,\nTo which the Levantines are very partial.\n\nAnd further on a group of Grecian girls,\n  The first and tallest her white kerchief waving,\nWere strung together like a row of pearls,\n  Link'd hand in hand, and dancing; each too having\nDown her white neck long floating auburn curls\n  (The least of which would set ten poets raving);\nTheir leader sang—and bounded to her song,\nWith choral step and voice, the virgin throng.\n\nAnd here, assembled cross-legg'd round their trays,\n  Small social parties just begun to dine;\nPilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze,\n  And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,\nAnd sherbet cooling in the porous vase;\n  Above them their dessert grew on its vine,\nThe orange and pomegranate nodding o'er\nDropp'd in their laps, scarce pluck'd, their mellow store.\n\nA band of children, round a snow-white ram,\n  There wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;\nWhile peaceful as if still an unwean'd lamb,\n  The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers\nHis sober head, majestically tame,\n  Or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers\nHis brow, as if in act to butt, and then\nYielding to their small hands, draws back again.\n\nTheir classical profiles, and glittering dresses,\n  Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,\nCrimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,\n  The gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,\nThe innocence which happy childhood blesses,\n  Made quite a picture of these little Greeks;\nSo that the philosophical beholder\nSigh'd for their sakes—that they should e'er grow older.\n\nAfar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales\n  To a sedate grey circle of old smokers,\nOf secret treasures found in hidden vales,\n  Of wonderful replies from Arab jokers,\nOf charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,\n  Of rocks bewitch'd that open to the knockers,\nOf magic ladies who, by one sole act,\nTransform'd their lords to beasts (but that 's a fact).\n\nHere was no lack of innocent diversion\n  For the imagination or the senses,\nSong, dance, wine, music, stories from the Persian,\n  All pretty pastimes in which no offence is;\nBut Lambro saw all these things with aversion,\n  Perceiving in his absence such expenses,\nDreading that climax of all human ills,\nThe inflammation of his weekly bills.\n\nAh! what is man? what perils still environ\n  The happiest mortals even after dinner—\nA day of gold from out an age of iron\n  Is all that life allows the luckiest sinner;\nPleasure (whene'er she sings, at least) 's a siren,\n  That lures, to flay alive, the young beginner;\nLambro's reception at his people's banquet\nWas such as fire accords to a wet blanket.\n\nHe—being a man who seldom used a word\n  Too much, and wishing gladly to surprise\n(In general he surprised men with the sword)\n  His daughter—had not sent before to advise\nOf his arrival, so that no one stirr'd;\n  And long he paused to re-assure his eyes\nIn fact much more astonish'd than delighted,\nTo find so much good company invited.\n\nHe did not know (alas! how men will lie)\n  That a report (especially the Greeks)\nAvouch'd his death (such people never die),\n  And put his house in mourning several weeks,—\nBut now their eyes and also lips were dry;\n  The bloom, too, had return'd to Haidee's cheeks,\nHer tears, too, being return'd into their fount,\nShe now kept house upon her own account.\n\nHence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,\n  Which turn'd the isle into a place of pleasure;\nThe servants all were getting drunk or idling,\n  A life which made them happy beyond measure.\nHer father's hospitality seem'd middling,\n  Compared with what Haidee did with his treasure;\n'T was wonderful how things went on improving,\nWhile she had not one hour to spare from loving.\n\nPerhaps you think in stumbling on this feast\n  He flew into a passion, and in fact\nThere was no mighty reason to be pleased;\n  Perhaps you prophesy some sudden act,\nThe whip, the rack, or dungeon at the least,\n  To teach his people to be more exact,\nAnd that, proceeding at a very high rate,\nHe show'd the royal penchants of a pirate.\n\nYou 're wrong.—He was the mildest manner'd man\n  That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat:\nWith such true breeding of a gentleman,\n  You never could divine his real thought;\nNo courtier could, and scarcely woman can\n  Gird more deceit within a petticoat;\nPity he loved adventurous life's variety,\nHe was so great a loss to good society.\n\nAdvancing to the nearest dinner tray,\n  Tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest,\nWith a peculiar smile, which, by the way,\n  Boded no good, whatever it express'd,\nHe ask'd the meaning of this holiday;\n  The vinous Greek to whom he had address'd\nHis question, much too merry to divine\nThe questioner, fill'd up a glass of wine,\n\nAnd without turning his facetious head,\n  Over his shoulder, with a Bacchant air,\nPresented the o'erflowing cup, and said,\n  'Talking 's dry work, I have no time to spare.'\nA second hiccup'd, 'Our old master 's dead,\n  You 'd better ask our mistress who 's his heir.'\n'Our mistress!' quoth a third: 'Our mistress!—pooh!-\nYou mean our master—not the old, but new.'\n\nThese rascals, being new comers, knew not whom\n  They thus address'd—and Lambro's visage fell—\nAnd o'er his eye a momentary gloom\n  Pass'd, but he strove quite courteously to quell\nThe expression, and endeavouring to resume\n  His smile, requested one of them to tell\nThe name and quality of his new patron,\nWho seem'd to have turn'd Haidee into a matron.\n\n'I know not,' quoth the fellow, 'who or what\n  He is, nor whence he came—and little care;\nBut this I know, that this roast capon 's fat,\n  And that good wine ne'er wash'd down better fare;\nAnd if you are not satisfied with that,\n  Direct your questions to my neighbour there;\nHe 'll answer all for better or for worse,\nFor none likes more to hear himself converse.'\n\nI said that Lambro was a man of patience,\n  And certainly he show'd the best of breeding,\nWhich scarce even France, the paragon of nations,\n  E'er saw her most polite of sons exceeding;\nHe bore these sneers against his near relations,\n  His own anxiety, his heart, too, bleeding,\nThe insults, too, of every servile glutton,\nWho all the time was eating up his mutton.\n\nNow in a person used to much command—\n  To bid men come, and go, and come again—\nTo see his orders done, too, out of hand—\n  Whether the word was death, or but the chain—\nIt may seem strange to find his manners bland;\n  Yet such things are, which I can not explain,\nThough doubtless he who can command himself\nIs good to govern—almost as a Guelf.\n\nNot that he was not sometimes rash or so,\n  But never in his real and serious mood;\nThen calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,\n  He lay coil'd like the boa in the wood;\nWith him it never was a word and blow,\n  His angry word once o'er, he shed no blood,\nBut in his silence there was much to rue,\nAnd his one blow left little work for two.\n\nHe ask'd no further questions, and proceeded\n  On to the house, but by a private way,\nSo that the few who met him hardly heeded,\n  So little they expected him that day;\nIf love paternal in his bosom pleaded\n  For Haidee's sake, is more than I can say,\nBut certainly to one deem'd dead, returning,\nThis revel seem'd a curious mode of mourning.\n\nIf all the dead could now return to life\n  (Which God forbid!) or some, or a great many,\nFor instance, if a husband or his wife\n  (Nuptial examples are as good as any),\nNo doubt whate'er might be their former strife,\n  The present weather would be much more rainy—\nTears shed into the grave of the connection\nWould share most probably its resurrection.\n\nHe enter'd in the house no more his home,\n  A thing to human feelings the most trying,\nAnd harder for the heart to overcome,\n  Perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;\nTo find our hearthstone turn'd into a tomb,\n  And round its once warm precincts palely lying\nThe ashes of our hopes, is a deep grief,\nBeyond a single gentleman's belief.\n\nHe enter'd in the house—his home no more,\n  For without hearts there is no home; and felt\nThe solitude of passing his own door\n  Without a welcome; there he long had dwelt,\nThere his few peaceful days Time had swept o'er,\n  There his worn bosom and keen eye would melt\nOver the innocence of that sweet child,\nHis only shrine of feelings undefiled.\n\nHe was a man of a strange temperament,\n  Of mild demeanour though of savage mood,\nModerate in all his habits, and content\n  With temperance in pleasure, as in food,\nQuick to perceive, and strong to bear, and meant\n  For something better, if not wholly good;\nHis country's wrongs and his despair to save her\nHad stung him from a slave to an enslaver.\n\nThe love of power, and rapid gain of gold,\n  The hardness by long habitude produced,\nThe dangerous life in which he had grown old,\n  The mercy he had granted oft abused,\nThe sights he was accustom'd to behold,\n  The wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,\nHad cost his enemies a long repentance,\nAnd made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance.\n\nBut something of the spirit of old Greece\n  Flash'd o'er his soul a few heroic rays,\nSuch as lit onward to the Golden Fleece\n  His predecessors in the Colchian days;\nT is true he had no ardent love for peace—\n  Alas! his country show'd no path to praise:\nHate to the world and war with every nation\nHe waged, in vengeance of her degradation.\n\nStill o'er his mind the influence of the clime\n  Shed its Ionian elegance, which show'd\nIts power unconsciously full many a time,—\n  A taste seen in the choice of his abode,\nA love of music and of scenes sublime,\n  A pleasure in the gentle stream that flow'd\nPast him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,\nBedew'd his spirit in his calmer hours.\n\nBut whatsoe'er he had of love reposed\n  On that beloved daughter; she had been\nThe only thing which kept his heart unclosed\n  Amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen;\nA lonely pure affection unopposed:\n  There wanted but the loss of this to wean\nHis feelings from all milk of human kindness,\nAnd turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness.\n\nThe cubless tigress in her jungle raging\n  Is dreadful to the shepherd and the flock;\nThe ocean when its yeasty war is waging\n  Is awful to the vessel near the rock;\nBut violent things will sooner bear assuaging,\n  Their fury being spent by its own shock,\nThan the stern, single, deep, and wordless ire\nOf a strong human heart, and in a sire.\n\nIt is a hard although a common case\n  To find our children running restive—they\nIn whom our brightest days we would retrace,\n  Our little selves re-form'd in finer clay,\nJust as old age is creeping on apace,\n  And clouds come o'er the sunset of our day,\nThey kindly leave us, though not quite alone,\nBut in good company—the gout or stone.\n\nYet a fine family is a fine thing\n  (Provided they don't come in after dinner);\n'T is beautiful to see a matron bring\n  Her children up (if nursing them don't thin her);\nLike cherubs round an altar-piece they cling\n  To the fire-side (a sight to touch a sinner).\nA lady with her daughters or her nieces\nShines like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces.\n\nOld Lambro pass'd unseen a private gate,\n  And stood within his hall at eventide;\nMeantime the lady and her lover sate\n  At wassail in their beauty and their pride:\nAn ivory inlaid table spread with state\n  Before them, and fair slaves on every side;\nGems, gold, and silver, form'd the service mostly,\nMother of pearl and coral the less costly.\n\nThe dinner made about a hundred dishes;\n  Lamb and pistachio nuts—in short, all meats,\nAnd saffron soups, and sweetbreads; and the fishes\n  Were of the finest that e'er flounced in nets,\nDrest to a Sybarite's most pamper'd wishes;\n  The beverage was various sherbets\nOf raisin, orange, and pomegranate juice,\nSqueezed through the rind, which makes it best for use.\n\nThese were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,\n  And fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,\nAnd Mocha's berry, from Arabia pure,\n  In small fine China cups, came in at last;\nGold cups of filigree made to secure\n  The hand from burning underneath them placed,\nCloves, cinnamon, and saffron too were boil'd\nUp with the coffee, which (I think) they spoil'd.\n\nThe hangings of the room were tapestry, made\n  Of velvet panels, each of different hue,\nAnd thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;\n  And round them ran a yellow border too;\nThe upper border, richly wrought, display'd,\n  Embroider'd delicately o'er with blue,\nSoft Persian sentences, in lilac letters,\nFrom poets, or the moralists their betters.\n\nThese Oriental writings on the wall,\n  Quite common in those countries, are a kind\nOf monitors adapted to recall,\n  Like skulls at Memphian banquets, to the mind\nThe words which shook Belshazzar in his hall,\n  And took his kingdom from him: You will find,\nThough sages may pour out their wisdom's treasure,\nThere is no sterner moralist than Pleasure.\n\nA beauty at the season's close grown hectic,\n  A genius who has drunk himself to death,\nA rake turn'd methodistic, or Eclectic\n  (For that 's the name they like to pray beneath)—\nBut most, an alderman struck apoplectic,\n  Are things that really take away the breath,—\nAnd show that late hours, wine, and love are able\nTo do not much less damage than the table.\n\nHaidee and Juan carpeted their feet\n  On crimson satin, border'd with pale blue;\nTheir sofa occupied three parts complete\n  Of the apartment—and appear'd quite new;\nThe velvet cushions (for a throne more meet)\n  Were scarlet, from whose glowing centre grew\nA sun emboss'd in gold, whose rays of tissue,\nMeridian-like, were seen all light to issue.\n\nCrystal and marble, plate and porcelain,\n  Had done their work of splendour; Indian mats\nAnd Persian carpets, which the heart bled to stain,\n  Over the floors were spread; gazelles and cats,\nAnd dwarfs and blacks, and such like things, that gain\n  Their bread as ministers and favourites (that 's\nTo say, by degradation) mingled there\nAs plentiful as in a court, or fair.\n\nThere was no want of lofty mirrors, and\n  The tables, most of ebony inlaid\nWith mother of pearl or ivory, stood at hand,\n  Or were of tortoise-shell or rare woods made,\nFretted with gold or silver:—by command,\n  The greater part of these were ready spread\nWith viands and sherbets in ice—and wine—\nKept for all comers at all hours to dine.\n\nOf all the dresses I select Haidee's:\n  She wore two jelicks—one was of pale yellow;\nOf azure, pink, and white was her chemise—\n  'Neath which her breast heaved like a little billow;\nWith buttons form'd of pearls as large as peas,\n  All gold and crimson shone her jelick's fellow,\nAnd the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,\nLike fleecy clouds about the moon, flow'd round her.\n\nOne large gold bracelet clasp'd each lovely arm,\n  Lockless—so pliable from the pure gold\nThat the hand stretch'd and shut it without harm,\n  The limb which it adorn'd its only mould;\nSo beautiful—its very shape would charm;\n  And, clinging as if loath to lose its hold,\nThe purest ore enclosed the whitest skin\nThat e'er by precious metal was held in.\n\nAround, as princess of her father's land,\n  A like gold bar above her instep roll'd\nAnnounced her rank; twelve rings were on her hand;\n  Her hair was starr'd with gems; her veil's fine fold\nBelow her breast was fasten'd with a band\n  Of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;\nHer orange silk full Turkish trousers furl'd\nAbout the prettiest ankle in the world.\n\nHer hair's long auburn waves down to her heel\n  Flow'd like an Alpine torrent which the sun\nDyes with his morning light,—and would conceal\n  Her person if allow'd at large to run,\nAnd still they seem resentfully to feel\n  The silken fillet's curb, and sought to shun\nTheir bonds whene'er some Zephyr caught began\nTo offer his young pinion as her fan.\n\nRound her she made an atmosphere of life,\n  The very air seem'd lighter from her eyes,\nThey were so soft and beautiful, and rife\n  With all we can imagine of the skies,\nAnd pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife—\n  Too pure even for the purest human ties;\nHer overpowering presence made you feel\nIt would not be idolatry to kneel.\n\nHer eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged\n  (It is the country's custom), but in vain;\nFor those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,\n  The glossy rebels mock'd the jetty stain,\nAnd in their native beauty stood avenged:\n  Her nails were touch'd with henna; but again\nThe power of art was turn'd to nothing, for\nThey could not look more rosy than before.\n\nThe henna should be deeply dyed to make\n  The skin relieved appear more fairly fair;\nShe had no need of this, day ne'er will break\n  On mountain tops more heavenly white than her:\nThe eye might doubt if it were well awake,\n  She was so like a vision; I might err,\nBut Shakspeare also says, 't is very silly\n'To gild refined gold, or paint the lily'\n\nJuan had on a shawl of black and gold,\n  But a white baracan, and so transparent\nThe sparkling gems beneath you might behold,\n  Like small stars through the milky way apparent;\nHis turban, furl'd in many a graceful fold,\n  An emerald aigrette with Haidee's hair in 't\nSurmounted as its clasp—a glowing crescent,\nWhose rays shone ever trembling, but incessant.\n\nAnd now they were diverted by their suite,\n  Dwarfs, dancing girls, black eunuchs, and a poet,\nWhich made their new establishment complete;\n  The last was of great fame, and liked to show it:\nHis verses rarely wanted their due feet;\n  And for his theme—he seldom sung below it,\nHe being paid to satirize or flatter,\nAs the psalm says, 'inditing a good matter.'\n\nHe praised the present, and abused the past,\n  Reversing the good custom of old days,\nAn Eastern anti-jacobin at last\n  He turn'd, preferring pudding to no praise—\nFor some few years his lot had been o'ercast\n  By his seeming independent in his lays,\nBut now he sung the Sultan and the Pacha\nWith truth like Southey, and with verse like Crashaw.\n\nHe was a man who had seen many changes,\n  And always changed as true as any needle;\nHis polar star being one which rather ranges,\n  And not the fix'd—he knew the way to wheedle:\nSo vile he 'scaped the doom which oft avenges;\n  And being fluent (save indeed when fee'd ill),\nHe lied with such a fervour of intention—\nThere was no doubt he earn'd his laureate pension.\n\nBut he had genius,—when a turncoat has it,\n  The 'Vates irritabilis' takes care\nThat without notice few full moons shall pass it;\n  Even good men like to make the public stare:—\nBut to my subject—let me see—what was it?-\n  O!—the third canto—and the pretty pair—\nTheir loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode\nOf living in their insular abode.\n\nTheir poet, a sad trimmer, but no less\n  In company a very pleasant fellow,\nHad been the favourite of full many a mess\n  Of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;\nAnd though his meaning they could rarely guess,\n  Yet still they deign'd to hiccup or to bellow\nThe glorious meed of popular applause,\nOf which the first ne'er knows the second cause.\n\nBut now being lifted into high society,\n  And having pick'd up several odds and ends\nOf free thoughts in his travels for variety,\n  He deem'd, being in a lone isle, among friends,\nThat, without any danger of a riot, he\n  Might for long lying make himself amends;\nAnd, singing as he sung in his warm youth,\nAgree to a short armistice with truth.\n\nHe had travell'd 'mongst the Arabs, Turks, and Franks,\n  And knew the self-loves of the different nations;\nAnd having lived with people of all ranks,\n  Had something ready upon most occasions—\nWhich got him a few presents and some thanks.\n  He varied with some skill his adulations;\nTo 'do at Rome as Romans do,' a piece\nOf conduct was which he observed in Greece.\n\nThus, usually, when he was ask'd to sing,\n  He gave the different nations something national;\n'T was all the same to him—'God save the king,'\n  Or 'Ca ira,' according to the fashion all:\nHis muse made increment of any thing,\n  From the high lyric down to the low rational:\nIf Pindar sang horse-races, what should hinder\nHimself from being as pliable as Pindar?\n\nIn France, for instance, he would write a chanson;\n  In England a six canto quarto

Scian and the Teian muse,\n        The hero's harp, the lover's lute,\n      Have found the fame your shores refuse;\n        Their place of birth alone is mute\n      To sounds which echo further

there is no instinct like the heart—\n\nThe heart—which may be broken: happy they!\n  Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,\nThe precious porcelain of human clay,\n  Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold\nThe long year link'd with heavy day on day,\n  And all which must be borne, and never told;\nWhile life's strange principle will often lie\nDeepest in those who long the most to die.\n\n'Whom the gods love die young,' was said of yore,\n  And many deaths do they escape by this:\nThe death of friends, and that which slays even more—\n  The death of friendship, love, youth, all that is,\nExcept mere breath; and since the silent shore\n  Awaits at last even those who longest miss\nThe old archer's shafts, perhaps the early grave\nWhich men weep over may be meant to save.\n\nHaidee and Juan thought not of the dead—\n  The heavens, and earth, and air, seem'd made for them:\nThey found no fault with Time, save that he fled;\n  They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:\nEach was the other's mirror, and but read\n  Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem,\nAnd knew such brightness was but the reflection\nOf their exchanging glances of affection.\n\nThe gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,\n  The least glance better understood than words,\nWhich still said all, and ne'er could say too much;\n  A language, too, but like to that of birds,\nKnown but to them, at least appearing such\n  As but to lovers a true sense affords;\nSweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd\nTo those who have ceased to hear such, or ne'er heard,—\n\nAll these were theirs, for they were children still,\n  And children still they should have ever been;\nThey were not made in the real world to fill\n  A busy character in the dull scene,\nBut like two beings born from out a rill,\n  A nymph and her beloved, all unseen\nTo pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,\nAnd never know the weight of human hours.\n\nMoons changing had roll'd on, and changeless found\n  Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys\nAs rarely they beheld throughout their round;\n  And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,\nFor theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound\n  By the mere senses; and that which destroys\nMost love, possession, unto them appear'd\nA thing which each endearment more endear'd.\n\nO beautiful! and rare as beautiful\n  But theirs was love in which the mind delights\nTo lose itself when the old world grows dull,\n  And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,\nIntrigues, adventures of the common school,\n  Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,\nWhere Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,\nWhose husband only knows her not a wh—re.\n\nHard words; harsh truth; a truth which many know.\n  Enough.—The faithful and the fairy pair,\nWho never found a single hour too slow,\n  What was it made them thus exempt from care?\nYoung innate feelings all have felt below,\n  Which perish in the rest, but in them were\nInherent—what we mortals call romantic,\nAnd always envy, though we deem it frantic.\n\nThis is in others a factitious state,\n  An opium dream of too much youth and reading,\nBut was in them their nature or their fate:\n  No novels e'er had set their young hearts bleeding,\nFor Haidee's knowledge was by no means great,\n  And Juan was a boy of saintly breeding;\nSo that there was no reason for their loves\nMore than for those of nightingales or doves.\n\nThey gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour\n  Dear unto all, but dearest to their eyes,\nFor it had made them what they were: the power\n  Of love had first o'erwhelm'd them from such skies,\nWhen happiness had been their only dower,\n  And twilight saw them link'd in passion's ties;\nCharm'd with each other, all things charm'd that brought\nThe past still welcome as the present thought.\n\nI know not why, but in that hour to-night,\n  Even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,\nAnd swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,\n  Like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,\nWhen one is shook in sound, and one in sight;\n  And thus some boding flash'd through either frame,\nAnd call'd from Juan's breast a faint low sigh,\nWhile one new tear arose in Haidee's eye.\n\nThat large black prophet eye seem'd to dilate\n  And follow far the disappearing sun,\nAs if their last day! of a happy date\n  With his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;\nJuan gazed on her as to ask his fate—\n  He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,\nHis glance inquired of hers for some excuse\nFor feelings causeless, or at least abstruse.\n\nShe turn'd to him, and smiled, but in that sort\n  Which makes not others smile; then turn'd aside:\nWhatever feeling shook her, it seem'd short,\n  And master'd by her wisdom or her pride;\nWhen Juan spoke, too—it might be in sport—\n  Of this their mutual feeling, she replied—\n'If it should be so,—but—it cannot be—\nOr I at least shall not survive to see.'\n\nJuan would question further, but she press'd\n  His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,\nAnd then dismiss'd the omen from her breast,\n  Defying augury with that fond kiss;\nAnd no doubt of all methods 't is the best:\n  Some people prefer wine—'t is not amiss;\nI have tried both; so those who would a part take\nMay choose between the headache and the heartache.\n\nOne of the two, according to your choice,\n  Woman or wine, you 'll have to undergo;\nBoth maladies are taxes on our joys:\n  But which to choose, I really hardly know;\nAnd if I had to give a casting voice,\n  For both sides I could many reasons show,\nAnd then decide, without great wrong to either,\nIt were much better to have both than neither.\n\nJuan and Haidee gazed upon each other\n  With swimming looks of speechless tenderness,\nWhich mix'd all feelings, friend, child, lover, brother,\n  All that the best can mingle and express\nWhen two pure hearts are pour'd in one another,\n  And love too much, and yet can not love less;\nBut almost sanctify the sweet excess\nBy the immortal wish and power to bless.\n\nMix'd in each other's arms, and heart in heart,\n  Why did they not then die?—they had lived too long\nShould an hour come to bid them breathe apart;\n  Years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;\nThe world was not for them, nor the world's art\n  For beings passionate as Sappho's song;\nLove was born with them, in them, so intense,\nIt was their very spirit—not a sense.\n\nThey should have lived together deep in woods,\n  Unseen as sings the nightingale; they were\nUnfit to mix in these thick solitudes\n  Call'd social, haunts of Hate, and Vice, and Care:\nHow lonely every freeborn creature broods!\n  The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;\nThe eagle soars alone; the gull and crow\nFlock o'er their carrion, just like men below.\n\nNow pillow'd cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,\n  Haidee and Juan their siesta took,\nA gentle slumber, but it was not deep,\n  For ever and anon a something shook\nJuan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;\n  And Haidee's sweet lips murmur'd like a brook\nA wordless music, and her face so fair\nStirr'd with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.\n\nOr as the stirring of a deep dear stream\n  Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind\nWalks o'er it, was she shaken by the dream,\n  The mystical usurper of the mind—\nO'erpowering us to be whate'er may seem\n  Good to the soul which we no more can bind;\nStrange state of being! (for 't is still to be)\nSenseless to feel, and with seal'd eyes to see.\n\nShe dream'd of being alone on the sea-shore,\n  Chain'd to a rock; she knew not how, but stir\nShe could not from the spot, and the loud roar\n  Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;\nAnd o'er her upper lip they seem'd to pour,\n  Until she sobb'd for breath, and soon they were\nFoaming o'er her lone head, so fierce and high—\nEach broke to drown her, yet she could not die.\n\nAnon—she was released, and then she stray'd\n  O'er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,\nAnd stumbled almost every step she made;\n  And something roll'd before her in a sheet,\nWhich she must still pursue howe'er afraid:\n  'T was white and indistinct, nor stopp'd to meet\nHer glance nor grasp, for still she gazed, and grasp'd,\nAnd ran, but it escaped her as she clasp'd.\n\nThe dream changed:—in a cave she stood, its walls\n  Were hung with marble icicles, the work\nOf ages on its water-fretted halls,\n  Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;\nHer hair was dripping, and the very balls\n  Of her black eyes seem'd turn'd to tears, and mirk\nThe sharp rocks look'd below each drop they caught,\nWhich froze to marble as it fell,—she thought.\n\nAnd wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,\n  Pale as the foam that froth'd on his dead brow,\nWhich she essay'd in vain to clear (how sweet\n  Were once her cares, how idle seem'd they now!),\nLay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat\n  Of his quench'd heart; and the sea dirges low\nRang in her sad ears like a mermaid's song,\nAnd that brief dream appear'd a life too long.\n\nAnd gazing on the dead, she thought his face\n  Faded, or alter'd into something new—\nLike to her father's features, till each trace—\n  More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew—\nWith all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;\n  And starting, she awoke, and what to view?\nO! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?\n'T is—'t is her father's—fix'd upon the pair!\n\nThen shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,\n  With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see\nHim whom she deem'd a habitant where dwell\n  The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be\nPerchance the death of one she loved too well:\n  Dear as her father had been to Haidee,\nIt was a moment of that awful kind—\nI have seen such—but must not call to mind.\n\nUp Juan sprung to Haidee's bitter shriek,\n  And caught her falling, and from off the wall\nSnatch'd down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak\n  Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:\nThen Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,\n  Smiled scornfully, and said, 'Within my call,\nA thousand scimitars await the word;\nPut up, young man, put up your silly sword.'\n\nAnd Haidee clung around him; 'Juan, 't is—\n  'T is Lambro—'t is my father! Kneel with me—\nHe will forgive us—yes—it must be—yes.\n  O! dearest father, in this agony\nOf pleasure and of pain—even while I kiss\n  Thy garment's hem with transport, can it be\nThat doubt should mingle with my filial joy?\nDeal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy.'\n\nHigh and inscrutable the old man stood,\n  Calm in his voice, and calm within his eye—\nNot always signs with him of calmest mood:\n  He look'd upon her, but gave no reply;\nThen turn'd to Juan, in whose cheek the blood\n  Oft came and went, as there resolved to die;\nIn arms, at least, he stood, in act to spring\nOn the first foe whom Lambro's call might bring.\n\n'Young man, your sword;' so Lambro once more said:\n  Juan replied, 'Not while this arm is free.'\nThe old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,\n  And drawing from his belt a pistol, he\nReplied, 'Your blood be then on your own head.'\n  Then look'd dose at the flint, as if to see\n'T was fresh—for he had lately used the lock—\nAnd next proceeded quietly to cock.\n\nIt has a strange quick jar upon the ear,\n  That cocking of a pistol, when you know\nA moment more will bring the sight to bear\n  Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;\nA gentlemanly distance, not too near,\n  If you have got a former friend for foe;\nBut after being fired at once or twice,\nThe ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.\n\nLambro presented, and one instant more\n  Had stopp'd this Canto, and Don Juan's breath,\nWhen Haidee threw herself her boy before;\n  Stern as her sire: 'On me,' she cried, 'let death\nDescend—the fault is mine; this fatal shore\n  He found—but sought not. I have pledged my faith;\nI love him—I will die with him: I knew\nYour nature's firmness—know your daughter's too.'\n\nA minute past, and she had been all tears,\n  And tenderness, and infancy; but now\nShe stood as one who champion'd human fears—\n  Pale, statue-like, and stern, she woo'd the blow;\nAnd tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,\n  She drew up to her height, as if to show\nA fairer mark; and with a fix'd eye scann'd\nHer father's face—but never stopp'd his hand.\n\nHe gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange\n  How like they look'd! the expression was the same;\nSerenely savage, with a little change\n  In the large dark eye's mutual-darted flame;\nFor she, too, was as one who could avenge,\n  If cause should be—a lioness, though tame.\nHer father's blood before her father's face\nBoil'd up, and proved her truly of his race.\n\nI said they were alike, their features and\n  Their stature, differing but in sex and years;\nEven to the delicacy of their hand\n  There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;\nAnd now to see them, thus divided, stand\n  In fix'd ferocity, when joyous tears\nAnd sweet sensations should have welcomed both,\nShow what the passions are in their full growth.\n\nThe father paused a moment, then withdrew\n  His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,\nAnd looking on her, as to look her through,\n  'Not I,' he said, 'have sought this stranger's ill;\nNot I have made this desolation: few\n  Would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill;\nBut I must do my duty—how thou hast\nDone thine, the present vouches for the past.\n\n'Let him disarm; or, by my father's head,\n  His own shall roll before you like a ball!'\nHe raised his whistle, as the word he said,\n  And blew; another answer'd to the call,\nAnd rushing in disorderly, though led,\n  And arm'd from boot to turban, one and all,\nSome twenty of his train came, rank on rank;\nHe gave the word,—'Arrest or slay the Frank.'\n\nThen, with a sudden movement, he withdrew\n  His daughter; while compress'd within his clasp,\n'Twixt her and Juan interposed the crew;\n  In vain she struggled in her father's grasp—\nHis arms were like a serpent's coil: then flew\n  Upon their prey, as darts an angry asp,\nThe file of pirates; save the foremost, who\nHad fallen, with his right shoulder half cut through.\n\nThe second had his cheek laid open; but\n  The third, a wary, cool old sworder, took\nThe blows upon his cutlass, and then put\n  His own well in; so well, ere you could look,\nHis man was floor'd, and helpless at his foot,\n  With the blood running like a little brook\nFrom two smart sabre gashes, deep and red—\nOne on the arm, the other on the head.\n\nAnd then they bound him where he fell, and bore\n  Juan from the apartment: with a sign\nOld Lambro bade them take him to the shore,\n  Where lay some ships which were to sail at nine.\nThey laid him in a boat, and plied the oar\n  Until they reach'd some galliots, placed in line;\nOn board of one of these, and under hatches,\nThey stow'd him, with strict orders to the watches.\n\nThe world is full of strange vicissitudes,\n  And here was one exceedingly unpleasant:\nA gentleman so rich in the world's goods,\n  Handsome and young, enjoying all the present,\nJust at the very time when he least broods\n  On such a thing is suddenly to sea sent,\nWounded and chain'd, so that he cannot move,\nAnd all because a lady fell in love.\n\nHere I must leave him, for I grow pathetic,\n  Moved by the Chinese nymph of tears, green tea!\nThan whom Cassandra was not more prophetic;\n  For if my pure libations exceed three,\nI feel my heart become so sympathetic,\n  That I must have recourse to black Bohea:\n'T is pity wine should be so deleterious,\nFor tea and coffee leave us much more serious,\n\nUnless when qualified with thee, Cogniac!\n  Sweet Naiad of the Phlegethontic rill!\nAh! why the liver wilt thou thus attack,\n  And make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?\nI would take refuge in weak punch, but rack\n  (In each sense of the word), whene'er I fill\nMy mild and midnight beakers to the brim,\nWakes me next morning with its synonym.\n\nI leave Don Juan for the present, safe—\n  Not sound, poor fellow, but severely wounded;\nYet could his corporal pangs amount to half\n  Of those with which his Haidee's bosom bounded?\nShe was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,\n  And then give way, subdued because surrounded;\nHer mother was a Moorish maid, from Fez,\nWhere all is Eden, or a wilderness.\n\nThere the large olive rains its amber store\n  In marble fonts; there grain, and flower, and fruit,\nGush from the earth until the land runs o'er;\n  But there, too, many a poison-tree has root,\nAnd midnight listens to the lion's roar,\n  And long, long deserts scorch the camel's foot,\nOr heaving whelm the helpless caravan;\nAnd as the soil is, so the heart of man.\n\nAfric is all the sun's, and as her earth\n  Her human day is kindled; full of power\nFor good or evil, burning from its birth,\n  The Moorish blood partakes the planet's hour,\nAnd like the soil beneath it will bring forth:\n  Beauty and love were Haidee's mother's dower;\nBut her large dark eye show'd deep Passion's force,\nThough sleeping like a lion near a source.\n\nHer daughter, temper'd with a milder ray,\n  Like summer clouds all silvery, smooth, and fair,\nTill slowly charged with thunder they display\n  Terror to earth, and tempest to the air,\nHad held till now her soft and milky way;\n  But overwrought with passion and despair,\nThe fire burst forth from her Numidian veins,\nEven as the Simoom sweeps the blasted plains.\n\nThe last sight which she saw was Juan's gore,\n  And he himself o'ermaster'd and cut down;\nHis blood was running on the very floor\n  Where late he trod, her beautiful, her own;\nThus much she view'd an instant and no more,—\n  Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;\nOn her sire's arm, which until now scarce held\nHer writhing, fell she like a cedar fell'd.\n\nA vein had burst, and her sweet lips' pure dyes\n  Were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o'er;\nAnd her head droop'd as when the lily lies\n  O'ercharged with rain: her summon'd handmaids bore\nTheir lady to her couch with gushing eyes;\n  Of herbs and cordials they produced their store,\nBut she defied all means they could employ,\nLike one life could not hold, nor death destroy.\n\nDays lay she in that state unchanged, though chill—\n  With nothing livid, still her lips were red;\nShe had no pulse, but death seem'd absent still;\n  No hideous sign proclaim'd her surely dead;\nCorruption came not in each mind to kill\n  All hope; to look upon her sweet face bred\nNew thoughts of life, for it seem'd full of soul—\nShe had so much, earth could not claim the whole.\n\nThe ruling passion, such as marble shows\n  When exquisitely chisell'd, still lay there,\nBut fix'd as marble's unchanged aspect throws\n  O'er the fair Venus, but for ever fair;\nO'er the Laocoon's all eternal throes,\n  And ever-dying Gladiator's air,\nTheir energy like life forms all their fame,\nYet looks not life, for they are still the same.\n\nShe woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,\n  Rather the dead, for life seem'd something new,\nA strange sensation which she must partake\n  Perforce, since whatsoever met her view\nStruck not on memory, though a heavy ache\n  Lay at her heart, whose earliest beat still true\nBrought back the sense of pain without the cause,\nFor, for a while, the furies made a pause.\n\nShe look'd on many a face with vacant eye,\n  On many a token without knowing what;\nShe saw them watch her without asking why,\n  And reck'd not who around her pillow sat;\nNot speechless, though she spoke not; not a sigh\n  Relieved her thoughts; dull silence and quick chat\nWere tried in vain by those who served; she gave\nNo sign, save breath, of having left the grave.\n\nHer handmaids tended, but she heeded not;\n  Her father watch'd, she turn'd her eyes away;\nShe recognized no being, and no spot,\n  However dear or cherish'd in their day;\nThey changed from room to room—but all forgot—\n  Gentle, but without memory she lay;\nAt length those eyes, which they would fain be weaning\nBack to old thoughts, wax'd full of fearful meaning.\n\nAnd then a slave bethought her of a harp;\n  The harper came, and tuned his instrument;\nAt the first notes, irregular and sharp,\n  On him her flashing eyes a moment bent,\nThen to the wall she turn'd as if to warp\n  Her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent;\nAnd he begun a long low island song\nOf ancient days, ere tyranny grew strong.\n\nAnon her thin wan fingers beat the wall\n  In time to his old tune; he changed the theme,\nAnd sung of love; the fierce name struck through all\n  Her recollection; on her flash'd the dream\nOf what she was, and is, if ye could call\n  To be so being; in a gushing stream\nThe tears rush'd forth from her o'erclouded brain,\nLike mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.\n\nShort solace, vain relief!—thought came too quick,\n  And whirl'd her brain to madness; she arose\nAs one who ne'er had dwelt among the sick,\n  And flew at all she met, as on her foes;\nBut no one ever heard her speak or shriek,\n  Although her paroxysm drew towards its dose;—\nHers was a phrensy which disdain'd to rave,\nEven when they smote her, in the hope to save.\n\nYet she betray'd at times a gleam of sense;\n  Nothing could make her meet her father's face,\nThough on all other things with looks intense\n  She gazed, but none she ever could retrace;\nFood she refused, and raiment; no pretence\n  Avail'd for either; neither change of place,\nNor time, nor skill, nor remedy, could give her\nSenses to sleep—the power seem'd gone for ever.\n\nTwelve days and nights she wither'd thus; at last,\n  Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show\nA parting pang, the spirit from her past:\n  And they who watch'd her nearest could not know\nThe very instant, till the change that cast\n  Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,\nGlazed o'er her eyes—the beautiful, the black—\nO! to possess such lustre—and then lack!\n\nShe died, but not alone; she held within\n  A second principle of life, which might\nHave dawn'd a fair and sinless child of sin;\n  But closed its little being without light,\nAnd went down to the grave unborn, wherein\n  Blossom and bough lie wither'd with one blight;\nIn vain the dews of Heaven descend above\nThe bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love.\n\nThus lived—thus died she; never more on her\n  Shall sorrow light, or shame. She was not made\nThrough years or moons the inner weight to bear,\n  Which colder hearts endure till they are laid\nBy age in earth: her days and pleasures were\n  Brief, but delightful—such as had not staid\nLong with her destiny; but she sleeps well\nBy the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.\n\nThat isle is now all desolate and bare,\n  Its dwellings down, its tenants pass'd away;\nNone but her own and father's grave is there,\n  And nothing outward tells of human clay;\nYe could not know where lies a thing so fair,\n  No stone is there to show, no tongue to say\nWhat was; no dirge, except the hollow sea's,\nMourns o'er the beauty of the Cyclades.\n\nBut many a Greek maid in a loving song\n  Sighs o'er her name; and many an islander\nWith her sire's story makes the night less long;\n  Valour was his, and beauty dwelt with her:\nIf she loved rashly, her life paid for wrong—\n  A heavy price must all pay who thus err,\nIn some shape; let none think to fly the danger,\nFor soon or late Love is his own avenger.\n\nBut let me change this theme which grows too sad,\n  And lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf;\nI don't much like describing people mad,\n  For fear of seeming rather touch'd myself—\nBesides, I 've no more on this head to add;\n  And as my Muse is a capricious elf,\nWe 'll put about, and try another tack\nWith Juan, left half-kill'd some stanzas back.\n\nWounded and fetter'd, 'cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,'\n  Some days and nights elapsed before that he\nCould altogether call the past to mind;\n  And when he did, he found himself at sea,\nSailing six knots an hour before the wind;\n  The shores of Ilion lay beneath their lee—\nAnother time he might have liked to see 'em,\nBut now was not much pleased with Cape Sigaeum.\n\nThere, on the green and village-cotted hill, is\n  (Flank'd by the Hellespont and by the sea)\nEntomb'd the bravest of the brave, Achilles;\n  They say so (Bryant says the contrary):\nAnd further downward, tall and towering still, is\n  The tumulus—of whom? Heaven knows! 't may be\nPatroclus, Ajax, or Protesilaus—\nAll heroes, who if living still would slay us.\n\nHigh barrows, without marble or a name,\n  A vast, untill'd, and mountain-skirted plain,\nAnd Ida in the distance, still the same,\n  And old Scamander (if 't is he) remain;\nThe situation seems still form'd for fame—\n  A hundred thousand men might fight again\nWith case; but where I sought for Ilion's walls,\nThe quiet sheep feeds, and the tortoise crawls;\n\nTroops of untended horses; here and there\n  Some little hamlets, with new names uncouth;\nSome shepherds (unlike Paris) led to stare\n  A moment at the European youth\nWhom to the spot their school-boy feelings bear;\n  A turk, with beads in hand and pipe in mouth,\nExtremely taken with his own religion,\nAre what I found there—but the devil a Phrygian.\n\nDon Juan, here permitted to emerge\n  From his dull cabin, found himself a slave;\nForlorn, and gazing on the deep blue surge,\n  O'ershadow'd there by many a hero's grave;\nWeak still with loss of blood, he scarce could urge\n  A few brief questions; and the answers gave\nNo very satisfactory information\nAbout his past or present situation.\n\nHe saw some fellow captives, who appear'd\n  To be Italians, as they were in fact;\nFrom them, at least, their destiny he heard,\n  Which was an odd one; a troop going to act\nIn Sicily (all singers, duly rear'd\n  In their vocation) had not been attack'd\nIn sailing from Livorno by the pirate,\nBut sold by the impresario at no high rate.\n\nBy one of these, the buffo of the party,\n  Juan was told about their curious case;\nFor although destined to the Turkish mart, he\n  Still kept his spirits up—at least his face;\nThe little fellow really look'd quite hearty,\n  And bore him with some gaiety and grace,\nShowing a much more reconciled demeanour,\nThan did the prima donna and the tenor.\n\nIn a few words he told their hapless story,\n  Saying, 'Our Machiavellian impresario,\nMaking a signal off some promontory,\n  Hail'd a strange brig—Corpo di Caio Mario!\nWe were transferr'd on board her in a hurry,\n  Without a Single scudo of salario;\nBut if the Sultan has a taste for song,\nWe will revive our fortunes before long.\n\n'The prima donna, though a little old,\n  And haggard with a dissipated life,\nAnd subject, when the house is thin, to cold,\n  Has some good notes; and then the tenor's wife,\nWith no great voice, is pleasing to behold;\n  Last carnival she made a deal of strife\nBy carrying off Count Cesare Cicogna\nFrom an old Roman princess at Bologna.\n\n'And then there are the dancers; there 's the Nini,\n  With more than one profession, gains by all;\nThen there 's that laughing slut the Pelegrini,\n  She, too, was fortunate last carnival,\nAnd made at least five hundred good zecchini,\n  But spends so fast, she has not now a paul;\nAnd then there 's the Grotesca—such a dancer!\nWhere men have souls or bodies she must answer.\n\n'As for the figuranti, they are like\n  The rest of all that tribe; with here and there\nA pretty person, which perhaps may strike,\n  The rest are hardly fitted for a fair;\nThere 's one, though tall and stiffer than a pike,\n  Yet has a sentimental kind of air\nWhich might go far, but she don't dance with vigour;\nThe more 's the pity, with her face and figure.\n\n'As for the men, they are a middling set;\n  The musico is but a crack'd old basin,\nBut being qualified in one way yet,\n  May the seraglio do to set his face in,\nAnd as a servant some preferment get;\n  His singing I no further trust can place in:\nFrom all the Pope makes yearly 't would perplex\nTo find three perfect pipes of the third sex.\n\n'The tenor's voice is spoilt by affectation,\n  And for the bass, the beast can only bellow;\nIn fact, he had no singing education,\n  An ignorant, noteless, timeless, tuneless fellow;\nBut being the prima donna's near relation,\n  Who swore his voice was very rich and mellow,\nThey hired him, though to hear him you 'd believe\nAn ass was practising recitative.\n\n''T would not become myself to dwell upon\n  My own merits, and though young—I see, Sir—you\nHave got a travell'd air, which speaks you one\n  To whom the opera is by no means new:\nYou 've heard of Raucocanti?—I 'm the man;\n  The time may come when you may hear me too;\nYou was not last year at the fair of Lugo,\nBut next, when I 'm engaged to sing there—do go.\n\n'Our baritone I almost had forgot,\n  A pretty lad, but bursting with conceit;\nWith graceful action, science not a jot,\n  A voice of no great compass, and not sweet,\nHe always is complaining of his lot,\n  Forsooth, scarce fit for ballads in the street;\nIn lovers' parts his passion more to breathe,\nHaving no heart to show, he shows his teeth.'\n\nHere Raucocanti's eloquent recital\n  Was interrupted by the pirate crew,\nWho came at stated moments to invite all\n  The captives back to their sad berths; each threw\nA rueful glance upon the waves (which bright all\n  From the blue skies derived a double blue,\nDancing all free and happy in the sun),\nAnd then went down the hatchway one by one.\n\nThey heard next day—that in the Dardanelles,\n  Waiting for his Sublimity's firman,\nThe most imperative of sovereign spells,\n  Which every body does without who can,\nMore to secure them in their naval cells,\n  Lady to lady, well as man to man,\nWere to be chain'd and lotted out per couple,\nFor the slave market of Constantinople.\n\nIt seems when this allotment was made out,\n  There chanced to be an odd male, and odd female,\nWho (after some discussion and some doubt,\n  If the soprano might be deem'd to be male,\nThey placed him o'er the women as a scout)\n  Were link'd together, and it happen'd the male\nWas Juan,—who, an awkward thing at his age,\nPair'd off with a Bacchante blooming visage.\n\nWith Raucocanti lucklessly was chain'd\n  The tenor; these two hated with a hate\nFound only on the stage, and each more pain'd\n  With this his tuneful neighbour than his fate;\nSad strife arose, for they were so cross-grain'd,\n  Instead of bearing up without debate,\nThat each pull'd different ways with many an oath,\n'Arcades ambo,' id est—blackguards both.\n\nJuan's companion was a Romagnole,\n  But bred within the March of old Ancona,\nWith eyes that look'd into the very soul\n  (And other chief points of a 'bella donna'),\nBright—and as black and burning as a coal;\n  And through her dear brunette complexion shone\nGreat wish to please—a most attractive dower,\nEspecially when added to the power.\n\nBut all that power was wasted upon him,\n  For sorrow o'er each sense held stern command;\nHer eye might flash on his, but found it dim;\n  And though thus chain'd, as natural her hand\nTouch'd his, nor that—nor any handsome limb\n  (And she had some not easy to withstand)\nCould stir his pulse, or make his faith feel brittle;\nPerhaps his recent wounds might help a little.\n\nNo matter; we should ne'er too much enquire,\n  But facts are facts: no knight could be more true,\nAnd firmer faith no ladye—love desire;\n  We will omit the proofs, save one or two:\n'T is said no one in hand 'can hold a fire\n  By thought of frosty Caucasus;' but few,\nI really think; yet Juan's then ordeal\nWas more triumphant, and not much less real.\n\nHere I might enter on a chaste description,\n  Having withstood temptation in my youth,\nBut hear that several people take exception\n  At the first two books having too much truth;\nTherefore I 'll make Don Juan leave the ship soon,\n  Because the publisher declares, in sooth,\nThrough needles' eyes it easier for the camel is\nTo pass, than those two cantos into families.\n\n'T is all the same to me; I 'm fond of yielding,\n  And therefore leave them to the purer page\nOf Smollett, Prior, Ariosto, Fielding,\n  Who say strange things for so correct an age;\nI once had great alacrity in wielding\n  My pen, and liked poetic war to wage,\nAnd recollect the time when all this cant\nWould have provoked remarks which now it shan't.\n\nAs boys love rows, my boyhood liked a squabble;\n  But at this hour I wish to part in peace,\nLeaving such to the literary rabble:\n  Whether my verse's fame be doom'd to cease\nWhile the right hand which wrote it still is able,\n  Or of some centuries to take a lease,\nThe grass upon my grave will grow as long,\nAnd sigh to midnight winds, but not to song.\n\nOf poets who come down to us through distance\n  Of time and tongues, the foster-babes of Fame,\nLife seems the smallest portion of existence;\n  Where twenty ages gather o'er a name,\n'T is as a snowball which derives assistance\n  From every flake, and yet rolls on the same,\nEven till an iceberg it may chance to grow;\nBut, after all, 't is nothing but cold snow.\n\nAnd so great names are nothing more than nominal,\n  And love of glory 's but an airy lust,\nToo often in its fury overcoming all\n  Who would as 't were identify their dust\nFrom out the wide destruction, which, entombing all,\n  Leaves nothing till 'the coming of the just'-\nSave change: I 've stood upon Achilles' tomb,\nAnd heard Troy doubted; time will doubt of Rome.\n\nThe very generations of the dead\n  Are swept away, and tomb inherits tomb,\nUntil the memory of an age is fled,\n  And, buried, sinks beneath its offspring's doom:\nWhere are the epitaphs our fathers read?\n  Save a few glean'd from the sepulchral gloom\nWhich once-named myriads nameless lie beneath,\nAnd lose their own in universal death.\n\nI canter by the spot each afternoon\n  Where perish'd in his fame the hero-boy,\nWho lived too long for men, but died too soon\n  For human vanity, the young De Foix!\nA broken pillar, not uncouthly hewn,\n  But which neglect is hastening to destroy,\nRecords Ravenna's carnage on its face,\nWhile weeds and ordure rankle round the base.\n\nI pass each day where Dante's bones are laid:\n  A little cupola, more neat than solemn,\nProtects his dust, but reverence here is paid\n  To the bard's tomb, and not the warrior's column.\nThe time must come, when both alike decay'd,\n  The chieftain's trophy, and the poet's volume,\nWill sink where lie the songs and wars of earth,\nBefore Pelides' death, or Homer's birth.\n\nWith human blood that column was cemented,\n  With human filth that column is defiled,\nAs if the peasant's coarse contempt were vented\n  To show his loathing of the spot he soil'd:\nThus is the trophy used, and thus lamented\n  Should ever be those blood-hounds, from whose wild\nInstinct of gore and glory earth has known\nThose sufferings Dante saw in hell alone.\n\nYet there will still be bards: though fame is smoke,\n  Its fumes are frankincense to human thought;\nAnd the unquiet feelings, which first woke\n  Song in the world, will seek what then they sought;\nAs on the beach the waves at last are broke,\n  Thus to their extreme verge the passions brought\nDash into poetry, which is but passion,\nOr at least was so ere it grew a fashion.\n\nIf in the course of such a life as was\n  At once adventurous and contemplative,\nMen, who partake all passions as they pass,\n  Acquire the deep and bitter power to give\nTheir images again as in a glass,\n  And in such colours that they seem to live;\nYou may do right forbidding them to show 'em,\nBut spoil (I think) a very pretty poem.\n\nO! ye, who make the fortunes of all books!\n  Benign Ceruleans of the second sex!\nWho advertise new poems by your looks,\n  Your 'imprimatur' will ye not annex?\nWhat! must I go to the oblivious cooks,\n  Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?\nAh! must I then the only minstrel be,\nProscribed from tasting your Castalian tea!\n\nWhat! can I prove 'a lion' then no more?\n  A ball-room bard, a foolscap, hot-press darling?\nTo bear the compliments of many a bore,\n  And sigh, 'I can't get out,' like Yorick's starling;\nWhy then I 'll swear, as poet Wordy swore\n  (Because the world won't read him, always snarling),\nThat taste is gone, that fame is but a lottery,\nDrawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie.\n\nO! 'darkly, deeply, beautifully blue,'\n  As some one somewhere sings about the sky,\nAnd I, ye learned ladies, say of you;\n  They say your stockings are so (Heaven knows why,\nI have examined few pair of that hue);\n  Blue as the garters which serenely lie\nRound the Patrician left-legs, which adorn\nThe festal midnight, and the levee morn.\n\nYet some of you are most seraphic creatures—\n  But times are alter'd since, a rhyming lover,\nYou read my stanzas, and I read your features:\n  And—but no matter, all those things are over;\nStill I have no dislike to learned natures,\n  For sometimes such a world of virtues cover;\nI knew one woman of that purple school,\nThe loveliest, chastest, best, but—quite a fool.\n\nHumboldt, 'the first of travellers,' but not\n  The last, if late accounts be accurate,\nInvented, by some name I have forgot,\n  As well as the sublime discovery's date,\nAn airy instrument, with which he sought\n  To ascertain the atmospheric state,\nBy measuring 'the intensity of blue:'\nO, Lady Daphne! let me measure you!\n\nBut to the narrative:—The vessel bound\n  With slaves to sell off in the capital,\nAfter the usual process, might be found\n  At anchor under the seraglio wall;\nHer cargo, from the plague being safe and sound,\n  Were landed in the market, one and all,\nAnd there with Georgians, Russians, and Circassians,\nBought up for different purposes and passions.\n\nSome went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars\n  For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,\nWarranted virgin; beauty's brightest colours\n  Had deck'd her out in all the hues of heaven:\nHer sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,\n  Who bade on till the hundreds reach'd eleven;\nBut when the offer went beyond, they knew\n'T was for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.\n\nTwelve negresses from Nubia brought a price\n  Which the West Indian market scarce would bring;\nThough Wilberforce, at last, has made it twice\n  What 't was ere Abolition; and the thing\nNeed not seem very wonderful, for vice\n  Is always much more splendid than a king:\nThe virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,\nAre saving—vice spares nothing for a rarity.\n\nBut for the destiny of this young troop,\n  How some were bought by pachas, some by Jews,\nHow some to burdens were obliged to stoop,\n  And others rose to the command of crews\nAs renegadoes; while in hapless group,\n  Hoping no very old vizier might choose,\nThe females stood, as one by one they pick'd 'em,\nTo make a mistress, or fourth wife, or victim:\n\nAll this must be reserved for further song;\n  Also our hero's lot, howe'er unpleasant\n(Because this Canto has become too long),\n  Must be postponed discreetly for the present;\nI 'm sensible redundancy is wrong,\n  But could not for the muse of me put less in 't:\nAnd now delay the progress of Don Juan,\nTill what is call'd in Ossian the fifth Juan.</code>"

their good looks were sadly changed.\nAll save the blacks seem'd jaded with vexation,\n  From friends, and home, and freedom far estranged;\nThe negroes more philosophy display'd,—\nUsed to it, no doubt, as eels are to be flay'd.\n\nJuan was juvenile, and thus was full,\n  As most at his age are, of hope and health;\nYet I must own he looked a little dull,\n  And now and then a tear stole down by stealth;\nPerhaps his recent loss of blood might pull\n  His spirit down; and then the loss of wealth,\nA mistress, and such comfortable quarters,\nTo be put up for auction amongst Tartars,\n\nWere things to shake a stoic; ne'ertheless,\n  Upon the whole his carriage was serene:\nHis figure, and the splendour of his dress,\n  Of which some gilded remnants still were seen,\nDrew all eyes on him, giving them to guess\n  He was above the vulgar by his mien;\nAnd then, though pale, he was so very handsome;\nAnd then—they calculated on his ransom.\n\nLike a backgammon board the place was dotted\n  With whites and blacks, in groups on show for sale,\nThough rather more irregularly spotted:\n  Some bought the jet, while others chose the pale.\nIt chanced amongst the other people lotted,\n  A man of thirty rather stout and hale,\nWith resolution in his dark grey eye,\nNext Juan stood, till some might choose to buy.\n\nHe had an English look; that is, was square\n  In make, of a complexion white and ruddy,\nGood teeth, with curling rather dark brown hair,\n  And, it might be from thought or toil or study,\nAn open brow a little mark'd with care:\n  One arm had on a bandage rather bloody;\nAnd there he stood with such sang-froid, that greater\nCould scarce be shown even by a mere spectator.\n\nBut seeing at his elbow a mere lad,\n  Of a high spirit evidently, though\nAt present weigh'd down by a doom which had\n  O'erthrown even men, he soon began to show\nA kind of blunt compassion for the sad\n  Lot of so young a partner in the woe,\nWhich for himself he seem'd to deem no worse\nThan any other scrape, a thing of course.\n\n'My boy!' said he, 'amidst this motley crew\n  Of Georgians, Russians, Nubians, and what not,\nAll ragamuffins differing but in hue,\n  With whom it is our luck to cast our lot,\nThe only gentlemen seem I and you;\n  So let us be acquainted, as we ought:\nIf I could yield you any consolation,\n'T would give me pleasure.—Pray, what is your nation?'\n\nWhen Juan answer'd—'Spanish!' he replied,\n  'I thought, in fact, you could not be a Greek;\nThose servile dogs are not so proudly eyed:\n  Fortune has play'd you here a pretty freak,\nBut that 's her way with all men, till they 're tried;\n  But never mind,—she 'll turn, perhaps, next week;\nShe has served me also much the same as you,\nExcept that I have found it nothing new.'\n\n'Pray, sir,' said Juan, 'if I may presume,\n  What brought you here?'—'Oh! nothing very rare—\nSix Tartars and a drag-chain.'—'To this doom\n  But what conducted, if the question's fair,\nIs that which I would learn.'—'I served for some\n  Months with the Russian army here and there,\nAnd taking lately, by Suwarrow's bidding,\nA town, was ta'en myself instead of Widdin.'\n\n'Have you no friends?'—'I had—but, by God's blessing,\n  Have not been troubled with them lately. Now\nI have answer'd all your questions without pressing,\n  And you an equal courtesy should show.'\n'Alas!' said Juan, ''t were a tale distressing,\n  And long besides.'—'Oh! if 't is really so,\nYou 're right on both accounts to hold your tongue;\nA sad tale saddens doubly, when 't is long.\n\n'But droop not: Fortune at your time of life,\n  Although a female moderately fickle,\nWill hardly leave you (as she 's not your wife)\n  For any length of days in such a pickle.\nTo strive, too, with our fate were such a strife\n  As if the corn-sheaf should oppose the sickle:\nMen are the sport of circumstances, when\nThe circumstances seem the sport of men.'\n\n''T is not,' said Juan, 'for my present doom\n  I mourn, but for the past;—I loved a maid:'-\nHe paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom;\n  A single tear upon his eyelash staid\nA moment, and then dropp'd; 'but to resume,\n  'T is not my present lot, as I have said,\nWhich I deplore so much; for I have borne\nHardships which have the hardiest overworn,\n\n'On the rough deep. But this last blow-' and here\n  He stopp'd again, and turn'd away his face.\n'Ay,' quoth his friend, 'I thought it would appear\n  That there had been a lady in the case;\nAnd these are things which ask a tender tear,\n  Such as I, too, would shed if in your place:\nI cried upon my first wife's dying day,\nAnd also when my second ran away:\n\n'My third-'—'Your third!' quoth Juan, turning round;\n  'You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?'\n'No—only two at present above ground:\n  Surely 't is nothing wonderful to see\nOne person thrice in holy wedlock bound!'\n  'Well, then, your third,' said Juan; 'what did she?\nShe did not run away, too,—did she, sir?'\n'No, faith.'—'What then?'—'I ran away from her.'\n\n'You take things coolly, sir,' said Juan. 'Why,'\n  Replied the other, 'what can a man do?\nThere still are many rainbows in your sky,\n  But mine have vanish'd. All, when life is new,\nCommence with feelings warm, and prospects high;\n  But time strips our illusions of their hue,\nAnd one by one in turn, some grand mistake\nCasts off its bright skin yearly like the snake.\n\n''T is true, it gets another bright and fresh,\n  Or fresher, brighter; but the year gone through,\nThis skin must go the way, too, of all flesh,\n  Or sometimes only wear a week or two;—\nLove 's the first net which spreads its deadly mesh;\n  Ambition, Avarice, Vengeance, Glory, glue\nThe glittering lime-twigs of our latter days,\nWhere still we flutter on for pence or praise.'\n\n'All this is very fine, and may be true,'\n  Said Juan; 'but I really don't see how\nIt betters present times with me or you.'\n  'No?' quoth the other; 'yet you will allow\nBy setting things in their right point of view,\n  Knowledge, at least, is gain'd; for instance, now,\nWe know what slavery is, and our disasters\nMay teach us better to behave when masters.'\n\n'Would we were masters now, if but to try\n  Their present lessons on our Pagan friends here,'\nSaid Juan,—swallowing a heart-burning sigh:\n  'Heaven help the scholar whom his fortune sends here!'\n'Perhaps we shall be one day, by and by,'\n  Rejoin'd the other, when our bad luck mends here;\nMeantime (yon old black eunuch seems to eye us)\n\n'But after all, what is our present state?\n  'T is bad, and may be better—all men's lot:\nMost men are slaves, none more so than the great,\n  To their own whims and passions, and what not;\nSociety itself, which should create\n  Kindness, destroys what little we had got:\nTo feel for none is the true social art\nOf the world's stoics—men without a heart.'\n\nJust now a black old neutral personage\n  Of the third sex stept up, and peering over\nThe captives, seem'd to mark their looks and age,\n  And capabilities, as to discover\nIf they were fitted for the purposed cage:\n  No lady e'er is ogled by a lover,\nHorse by a blackleg, broadcloth by a tailor,\nFee by a counsel, felon by a jailor,\n\nAs is a slave by his intended bidder.\n  'T is pleasant purchasing our fellow-creatures;\nAnd all are to be sold, if you consider\n  Their passions, and are dext'rous; some by features\nAre bought up, others by a warlike leader,\n  Some by a place—as tend their years or natures;\nThe most by ready cash—but all have prices,\nFrom crowns to kicks, according to their vices.\n\nThe eunuch, having eyed them o'er with care,\n  Turn'd to the merchant, and begun to bid\nFirst but for one, and after for the pair;\n  They haggled, wrangled, swore, too—so they did!\nAs though they were in a mere Christian fair\n  Cheapening an ox, an ass, a lamb, or kid;\nSo that their bargain sounded like a battle\nFor this superior yoke of human cattle.\n\nAt last they settled into simple grumbling,\n  And pulling out reluctant purses, and\nTurning each piece of silver o'er, and tumbling\n  Some down, and weighing others in their hand,\nAnd by mistake sequins with paras jumbling,\n  Until the sum was accurately scann'd,\nAnd then the merchant giving change, and signing\nReceipts in full, began to think of dining.\n\nI wonder if his appetite was good?\n  Or, if it were, if also his digestion?\nMethinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude,\n  And conscience ask a curious sort of question,\nAbout the right divine how far we should\n  Sell flesh and blood. When dinner has opprest one,\nI think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour\nWhich turns up out of the sad twenty-four.\n\nVoltaire says 'No:' he tells you that Candide\n  Found life most tolerable after meals;\nHe 's wrong—unless man were a pig, indeed,\n  Repletion rather adds to what he feels,\nUnless he 's drunk, and then no doubt he 's freed\n  From his own brain's oppression while it reels.\nOf food I think with Philip's son, or rather\nAmmon's (ill pleased with one world and one father);\n\nI think with Alexander, that the act\n  Of eating, with another act or two,\nMakes us feel our mortality in fact\n  Redoubled; when a roast and a ragout,\nAnd fish, and soup, by some side dishes back'd,\n  Can give us either pain or pleasure, who\nWould pique himself on intellects, whose use\nDepends so much upon the gastric juice?\n\nThe other evening ('t was on Friday last)—\n  This is a fact and no poetic fable—\nJust as my great coat was about me cast,\n  My hat and gloves still lying on the table,\nI heard a shot—'t was eight o'clock scarce past—\n  And, running out as fast as I was able,\nI found the military commandant\nStretch'd in the street, and able scarce to pant.\n\nPoor fellow! for some reason, surely bad,\n  They had slain him with five slugs; and left him there\nTo perish on the pavement: so I had\n  Him borne into the house and up the stair,\nAnd stripp'd and look'd to—But why should I ad\n  More circumstances? vain was every care;\nThe man was gone: in some Italian quarrel\nKill'd by five bullets from an old gun-barrel.\n\nI gazed upon him, for I knew him well;\n  And though I have seen many corpses, never\nSaw one, whom such an accident befell,\n  So calm; though pierced through stomach, heart, and liver,\nHe seem'd to sleep,—for you could scarcely tell\n  (As he bled inwardly, no hideous river\nOf gore divulged the cause) that he was dead:\nSo as I gazed on him, I thought or said—\n\n'Can this be death? then what is life or death?\n  Speak!' but he spoke not: 'Wake!' but still he slept:—\n'But yesterday and who had mightier breath?\n  A thousand warriors by his word were kept\nIn awe: he said, as the centurion saith,\n  \"Go,\" and he goeth; \"come,\" and forth he stepp'd.\nThe trump and bugle till he spake were dumb—\nAnd now nought left him but the muffled drum.'\n\nAnd they who waited once and worshipp'd—they\n  With their rough faces throng'd about the bed\nTo gaze once more on the commanding clay\n  Which for the last, though not the first, time bled:\nAnd such an end! that he who many a day\n  Had faced Napoleon's foes until they fled,—\nThe foremost in the charge or in the sally,\nShould now be butcher'd in a civic alley.\n\nThe scars of his old wounds were near his new,\n  Those honourable scars which brought him fame;\nAnd horrid was the contrast to the view—\n  But let me quit the theme; as such things claim\nPerhaps even more attention than is due\n  From me: I gazed (as oft I have gazed the same)\nTo try if I could wrench aught out of death\nWhich should confirm, or shake, or make a faith;\n\nBut it was all a mystery. Here we are,\n  And there we go:—but where? five bits of lead,\nOr three, or two, or one, send very far!\n  And is this blood, then, form'd but to be shed?\nCan every element our elements mar?\n  And air—earth—water—fire live—and we dead?\nWe whose minds comprehend all things? No more;\nBut let us to the story as before.\n\nThe purchaser of Juan and acquaintance\n  Bore off his bargains to a gilded boat,\nEmbark'd himself and them, and off they went thence\n  As fast as oars could pull and water float;\nThey look'd like persons being led to sentence,\n  Wondering what next, till the caique was brought\nUp in a little creek below a wall\nO'ertopp'd with cypresses, dark-green and tall.\n\nHere their conductor tapping at the wicket\n  Of a small iron door, 't was open'd, and\nHe led them onward, first through a low thicket\n  Flank'd by large groves, which tower'd on either hand:\nThey almost lost their way, and had to pick it—\n  For night was dosing ere they came to land.\nThe eunuch made a sign to those on board,\nWho row'd off, leaving them without a word.\n\nAs they were plodding on their winding way\n  Through orange bowers, and jasmine, and so forth\n(Of which I might have a good deal to say,\n  There being no such profusion in the North\nOf oriental plants, 'et cetera,'\n  But that of late your scribblers think it worth\nTheir while to rear whole hotbeds in their works\nBecause one poet travell'd 'mongst the Turks)—\n\nAs they were threading on their way, there came\n  Into Don Juan's head a thought, which he\nWhisper'd to his companion:—'t was the same\n  Which might have then occurr'd to you or me.\n'Methinks,' said he, 'it would be no great shame\n  If we should strike a stroke to set us free;\nLet 's knock that old black fellow on the head,\nAnd march away—'t were easier done than said.'\n\n'Yes,' said the other, 'and when done, what then?\n  How get out? how the devil got we in?\nAnd when we once were fairly out, and when\n  From Saint Bartholomew we have saved our skin,\nTo-morrow 'd see us in some other den,\n  And worse off than we hitherto have been;\nBesides, I 'm hungry, and just now would take,\nLike Esau, for my birthright a beef-steak.\n\n'We must be near some place of man's abode;—\n  For the old negro's confidence in creeping,\nWith his two captives, by so queer a road,\n  Shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping;\nA single cry would bring them all abroad:\n  'T is therefore better looking before leaping—\nAnd there, you see, this turn has brought us through,\nBy Jove, a noble palace!—lighted too.'\n\nIt was indeed a wide extensive building\n  Which open'd on their view, and o'er the front\nThere seem'd to be besprent a deal of gilding\n  And various hues, as is the Turkish wont,—\nA gaudy taste; for they are little skill'd in\n  The arts of which these lands were once the font:\nEach villa on the Bosphorus looks a screen\nNew painted, or a pretty opera-scene.\n\nAnd nearer as they came, a genial savour\n  Of certain stews, and roast-meats, and pilaus,\nThings which in hungry mortals' eyes find favour,\n  Made Juan in his harsh intentions pause,\nAnd put himself upon his good behaviour:\n  His friend, too, adding a new saving clause,\nSaid, 'In Heaven's name let's get some supper now,\nAnd then I 'm with you, if you 're for a row.'\n\nSome talk of an appeal unto some passion,\n  Some to men's feelings, others to their reason;\nThe last of these was never much the fashion,\n  For reason thinks all reasoning out of season.\nSome speakers whine, and others lay the lash on,\n  But more or less continue still to tease on,\nWith arguments according to their 'forte;'\nBut no one dreams of ever being short.-\n\nBut I digress: of all appeals,—although\n  I grant the power of pathos, and of gold,\nOf beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling,—no\n  Method 's more sure at moments to take hold\nOf the best feelings of mankind, which grow\n  More tender, as we every day behold,\nThan that all-softening, overpowering knell,\nThe tocsin of the soul—the dinner-bell.\n\nTurkey contains no bells, and yet men dine;\n  And Juan and his friend, albeit they heard\nNo Christian knoll to table, saw no line\n  Of lackeys usher to the feast prepared,\nYet smelt roast-meat, beheld a huge fire shine,\n  And cooks in motion with their clean arms bared,\nAnd gazed around them to the left and right\nWith the prophetic eye of appetite.\n\nAnd giving up all notions of resistance,\n  They follow'd close behind their sable guide,\nWho little thought that his own crack'd existence\n  Was on the point of being set aside:\nHe motion'd them to stop at some small distance,\n  And knocking at the gate, 't was open'd wide,\nAnd a magnificent large hall display'd\nThe Asian pomp of Ottoman parade.\n\nI won't describe; description is my forte,\n  But every fool describes in these bright days\nHis wondrous journey to some foreign court,\n  And spawns his quarto, and demands your praise—\nDeath to his publisher, to him 't is sport;\n  While Nature, tortured twenty thousand ways,\nResigns herself with exemplary patience\nTo guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations.\n\nAlong this hall, and up and down, some, squatted\n  Upon their hams, were occupied at chess;\nOthers in monosyllable talk chatted,\n  And some seem'd much in love with their own dress.\nAnd divers smoked superb pipes decorated\n  With amber mouths of greater price or less;\nAnd several strutted, others slept, and some\nPrepared for supper with a glass of rum.\n\nAs the black eunuch enter'd with his brace\n  Of purchased Infidels, some raised their eyes\nA moment without slackening from their pace;\n  But those who sate ne'er stirr'd in anywise:\nOne or two stared the captives in the face,\n  Just as one views a horse to guess his price;\nSome nodded to the negro from their station,\nBut no one troubled him with conversation.\n\nHe leads them through the hall, and, without stopping,\n  On through a farther range of goodly rooms,\nSplendid but silent, save in one, where, dropping,\n  A marble fountain echoes through the glooms\nOf night which robe the chamber, or where popping\n  Some female head most curiously presumes\nTo thrust its black eyes through the door or lattice,\nAs wondering what the devil a noise that is.\n\nSome faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls\n  Gave light enough to hint their farther way,\nBut not enough to show the imperial halls,\n  In all the flashing of their full array;\nPerhaps there 's nothing—I 'll not say appals,\n  But saddens more by night as well as day,\nThan an enormous room without a soul\nTo break the lifeless splendour of the whole.\n\nTwo or three seem so little, one seems nothing:\n  In deserts, forests, crowds, or by the shore,\nThere solitude, we know, has her full growth in\n  The spots which were her realms for evermore;\nBut in a mighty hall or gallery, both in\n  More modern buildings and those built of yore,\nA kind of death comes o'er us all alone,\nSeeing what 's meant for many with but one.\n\nA neat, snug study on a winter's night,\n  A book, friend, single lady, or a glass\nOf claret, sandwich, and an appetite,\n  Are things which make an English evening pass;\nThough certes by no means so grand a sight\n  As is a theatre lit up by gas.\nI pass my evenings in long galleries solely,\nAnd that 's the reason I 'm so melancholy.\n\nAlas! man makes that great which makes him little:\n  I grant you in a church 't is very well:\nWhat speaks of Heaven should by no means be brittle,\n  But strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell\nTheir names who rear'd it; but huge houses fit ill—\n  And huge tombs worse—mankind, since Adam fell:\nMethinks the story of the tower of Babel\nMight teach them this much better than I 'm able.\n\nBabel was Nimrod's hunting-box, and then\n  A town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing,\nWhere Nabuchadonosor, king of men,\n  Reign'd, till one summer's day he took to grazing,\nAnd Daniel tamed the lions in their den,\n  The people's awe and admiration raising;\n'T was famous, too, for Thisbe and for Pyramus,\nAnd the calumniated queen Semiramis.\n\nThat injured Queen by chroniclers so coarse\n  Has been accused (I doubt not by conspiracy)\nOf an improper friendship for her horse\n  (Love, like religion, sometimes runs to heresy):\nThis monstrous tale had probably its source\n  (For such exaggerations here and there I see)\nIn writing 'Courser' by mistake for 'Courier:'\nI wish the case could come before a jury here.\n\nBut to resume,—should there be (what may not\n  Be in these days?) some infidels, who don't,\nBecause they can't find out the very spot\n  Of that same Babel, or because they won't\n(Though Claudius Rich, Esquire, some bricks has got,\n  And written lately two memoirs upon't),\nBelieve the Jews, those unbelievers, who\nMust be believed, though they believe not you,\n\nYet let them think that Horace has exprest\n  Shortly and sweetly the masonic folly\nOf those, forgetting the great place of rest,\n  Who give themselves to architecture wholly;\nWe know where things and men must end at best:\n  A moral (like all morals) melancholy,\nAnd 'Et sepulchri immemor struis domos'\nShows that we build when we should but entomb us.\n\nAt last they reach'd a quarter most retired,\n  Where echo woke as if from a long slumber;\nThough full of all things which could be desired,\n  One wonder'd what to do with such a number\nOf articles which nobody required;\n  Here wealth had done its utmost to encumber\nWith furniture an exquisite apartment,\nWhich puzzled Nature much to know what Art meant.\n\nIt seem'd, however, but to open on\n  A range or suite of further chambers, which\nMight lead to heaven knows where; but in this one\n  The movables were prodigally rich:\nSofas 't was half a sin to sit upon,\n  So costly were they; carpets every stitch\nOf workmanship so rare, they made you wish\nYou could glide o'er them like a golden fish.\n\nThe black, however, without hardly deigning\n  A glance at that which wrapt the slaves in wonder,\nTrampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining,\n  As if the milky way their feet was under\nWith all its stars; and with a stretch attaining\n  A certain press or cupboard niched in yonder—\nIn that remote recess which you may see—\nOr if you don't the fault is not in me,—\n\nI wish to be perspicuous; and the black,\n  I say, unlocking the recess, pull'd forth\nA quantity of clothes fit for the back\n  Of any Mussulman, whate'er his worth;\nAnd of variety there was no lack—\n  And yet, though I have said there was no dearth,\nHe chose himself to point out what he thought\nMost proper for the Christians he had bought.\n\nThe suit he thought most suitable to each\n  Was, for the elder and the stouter, first\nA Candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach,\n  And trousers not so tight that they would burst,\nBut such as fit an Asiatic breech;\n  A shawl, whose folds in Cashmire had been nurst,\nSlippers of saffron, dagger rich and handy;\nIn short, all things which form a Turkish Dandy.\n\nWhile he was dressing, Baba, their black friend,\n  Hinted the vast advantages which they\nMight probably attain both in the end,\n  If they would but pursue the proper way\nWhich fortune plainly seem'd to recommend;\n  And then he added, that he needs must say,\n''T would greatly tend to better their condition,\nIf they would condescend to circumcision.\n\n'For his own part, he really should rejoice\n  To see them true believers, but no less\nWould leave his proposition to their choice.'\n  The other, thanking him for this excess\nOf goodness, in thus leaving them a voice\n  In such a trifle, scarcely could express\n'Sufficiently' (he said) 'his approbation\nOf all the customs of this polish'd nation.\n\n'For his own share—he saw but small objection\n  To so respectable an ancient rite;\nAnd, after swallowing down a slight refection,\n  For which he own'd a present appetite,\nHe doubted not a few hours of reflection\n  Would reconcile him to the business quite.'\n'Will it?' said Juan, sharply: 'Strike me dead,\nBut they as soon shall circumcise my head!\n\n'Cut off a thousand heads, before-'—'Now, pray,'\n  Replied the other, 'do not interrupt:\nYou put me out in what I had to say.\n  Sir!—as I said, as soon as I have supt,\nI shall perpend if your proposal may\n  Be such as I can properly accept;\nProvided always your great goodness still\nRemits the matter to our own free-will.'\n\nBaba eyed Juan, and said, 'Be so good\n  As dress yourself-' and pointed out a suit\nIn which a Princess with great pleasure would\n  Array her limbs; but Juan standing mute,\nAs not being in a masquerading mood,\n  Gave it a slight kick with his Christian foot;\nAnd when the old negro told him to 'Get ready,'\nReplied, 'Old gentleman, I 'm not a lady.'\n\n'What you may be, I neither know nor care,'\n  Said Baba; 'but pray do as I desire:\nI have no more time nor many words to spare.'\n  'At least,' said Juan, 'sure I may enquire\nThe cause of this odd travesty?'—'Forbear,'\n  Said Baba, 'to be curious; 't will transpire,\nNo doubt, in proper place, and time, and season:\nI have no authority to tell the reason.'\n\n'Then if I do,' said Juan, 'I 'll be-'—'Hold!'\n  Rejoin'd the negro, 'pray be not provoking;\nThis spirit 's well, but it may wax too bold,\n  And you will find us not top fond of joking.'\n'What, sir!' said Juan, 'shall it e'er be told\n  That I unsex'd my dress?' But Baba, stroking\nThe things down, said, 'Incense me, and I call\nThose who will leave you of no sex at all.\n\n'I offer you a handsome suit of clothes:\n  A woman's, true; but then there is a cause\nWhy you should wear them.'—'What, though my soul loathes\n  The effeminate garb?'—thus, after a short pause,\nSigh'd Juan, muttering also some slight oaths,\n  'What the devil shall I do with all this gauze?'\nThus he profanely term'd the finest lace\nWhich e'er set off a marriage-morning face.\n\nAnd then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipp'd\n  A pair of trousers of flesh-colour'd silk;\nNext with a virgin zone he was equipp'd,\n  Which girt a slight chemise as white as milk;\nBut tugging on his petticoat, he tripp'd,\n  Which—as we say—or, as the Scotch say, whilk\n(The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes\nMonarchs are less imperative than rhymes)—\n\nWhilk, which (or what you please), was owing to\n  His garment's novelty, and his being awkward:\nAnd yet at last he managed to get through\n  His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:\nThe negro Baba help'd a little too,\n  When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;\nAnd, wrestling both his arms into a gown,\nHe paused, and took a survey up and down.\n\nOne difficulty still remain'd—his hair\n  Was hardly long enough; but Baba found\nSo many false long tresses all to spare,\n  That soon his head was most completely crown'd,\nAfter the manner then in fashion there;\n  And this addition with such gems was bound\nAs suited the ensemble of his toilet,\nWhile Baba made him comb his head and oil it.\n\nAnd now being femininely all array'd,\n  With some small aid from scissors, paint, and tweezers,\nHe look'd in almost all respects a maid,\n  And Baba smilingly exclaim'd, 'You see, sirs,\nA perfect transformation here display'd;\n  And now, then, you must come along with me, sirs,\nThat is—the Lady:' clapping his hands twice,\nFour blacks were at his elbow in a trice.\n\n'You, sir,' said Baba, nodding to the one,\n  'Will please to accompany those gentlemen\nTo supper; but you, worthy Christian nun,\n  Will follow me: no trifling, sir; for when\nI say a thing, it must at once be done.\n  What fear you? think you this a lion's den?\nWhy, 't is a palace; where the truly wise\nAnticipate the Prophet's paradise.\n\n'You fool! I tell you no one means you harm.'\n  'So much the better,' Juan said, 'for them;\nElse they shall feel the weight of this my arm,\n  Which is not quite so light as you may deem.\nI yield thus far; but soon will break the charm\n  If any take me for that which I seem:\nSo that I trust for everybody's sake,\nThat this disguise may lead to no mistake.'\n\n'Blockhead! come on, and see,' quoth Baba; while\n  Don Juan, turning to his comrade, who\nThough somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile\n  Upon the metamorphosis in view,—\n'Farewell!' they mutually exclaim'd: 'this soil\n  Seems fertile in adventures strange and new;\nOne 's turn'd half Mussulman, and one a maid,\nBy this old black enchanter's unsought aid.'\n\n'Farewell!' said Juan: 'should we meet no more,\n  I wish you a good appetite.'—'Farewell!'\nReplied the other; 'though it grieves me sore;\n  When we next meet we 'll have a tale to tell:\nWe needs must follow when Fate puts from shore.\n  Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell.'\n'Nay,' quoth the maid, 'the Sultan's self shan't carry me,\nUnless his highness promises to marry me.\n\nAnd thus they parted, each by separate doors;\n  Baba led Juan onward room by room\nThrough glittering galleries and o'er marble floors,\n  Till a gigantic portal through the gloom,\nHaughty and huge, along the distance lowers;\n  And wafted far arose a rich perfume:\nIt seem'd as though they came upon a shrine,\nFor all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine.\n\nThe giant door was broad, and bright, and high,\n  Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;\nWarriors thereon were battling furiously;\n  Here stalks the victor, there the vanquish'd lies;\nThere captives led in triumph droop the eye,\n  And in perspective many a squadron flies:\nIt seems the work of times before the line\nOf Rome transplanted fell with Constantine.\n\nThis massy portal stood at the wide close\n  Of a huge hall, and on its either side\nTwo little dwarfs, the least you could suppose,\n  Were sate, like ugly imps, as if allied\nIn mockery to the enormous gate which rose\n  O'er them in almost pyramidic pride:\nThe gate so splendid was in all its features,\nYou never thought about those little creatures,\n\nUntil you nearly trod on them, and then\n  You started back in horror to survey\nThe wondrous hideousness of those small men,\n  Whose colour was not black, nor white, nor grey,\nBut an extraneous mixture, which no pen\n  Can trace, although perhaps the pencil may;\nThey were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb—\nMonsters, who cost a no less monstrous sum.\n\nTheir duty was—for they were strong, and though\n  They look'd so little, did strong things at times—\nTo ope this door, which they could really do,\n  The hinges being as smooth as Rogers' rhymes;\nAnd now and then, with tough strings of the bow,\n  As is the custom of those Eastern climes,\nTo give some rebel Pacha a cravat;\nFor mutes are generally used for that.\n\nThey spoke by signs—that is, not spoke at all;\n  And looking like two incubi, they glared\nAs Baba with his fingers made them fall\n  To heaving back the portal folds: it scared\nJuan a moment, as this pair so small\n  With shrinking serpent optics on him stared;\nIt was as if their little looks could poison\nOr fascinate whome'er they fix'd their eyes on.\n\nBefore they enter'd, Baba paused to hint\n  To Juan some slight lessons as his guide:\n'If you could just contrive,' he said, 'to stint\n  That somewhat manly majesty of stride,\n'T would be as well, and (though there 's not much in 't)\n  To swing a little less from side to side,\nWhich has at times an aspect of the oddest;—\nAnd also could you look a little modest,\n\n''T would be convenient; for these mutes have eyes\n  Like needles, which may pierce those petticoats;\nAnd if they should discover your disguise,\n  You know how near us the deep Bosphorus floats;\nAnd you and I may chance, ere morning rise,\n  To find our way to Marmora without boats,\nStitch'd up in sacks—a mode of navigation\nA good deal practised here upon occasion.'\n\nWith this encouragement, he led the way\n  Into a room still nobler than the last;\nA rich confusion form'd a disarray\n  In such sort, that the eye along it cast\nCould hardly carry anything away,\n  Object on object flash'd so bright and fast;\nA dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter,\nMagnificently mingled in a litter.\n\nWealth had done wonders—taste not much; such things\n  Occur in Orient palaces, and even\nIn the more chasten'd domes of Western kings\n  (Of which I have also seen some six or seven),\nWhere I can't say or gold or diamond flings\n  Great lustre, there is much to be forgiven;\nGroups of bad statues, tables, chairs, and pictures,\nOn which I cannot pause to make my strictures.\n\nIn this imperial hall, at distance lay\n  Under a canopy, and there reclined\nQuite in a confidential queenly way,\n  A lady; Baba stopp'd, and kneeling sign'd\nTo Juan, who though not much used to pray,\n  Knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind,\nWhat all this meant: while Baba bow'd and bended\nHis head, until the ceremony ended.\n\nThe lady rising up with such an air\n  As Venus rose with from the wave, on them\nBent like an antelope a Paphian pair\n  Of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem;\nAnd raising up an arm as moonlight fair,\n  She sign'd to Baba, who first kiss'd the hem\nOf her deep purple robe, and speaking low,\nPointed to Juan who remain'd below.\n\nHer presence was as lofty as her state;\n  Her beauty of that overpowering kind,\nWhose force description only would abate:\n  I 'd rather leave it much to your own mind,\nThan lessen it by what I could relate\n  Of forms and features; it would strike you blind\nCould I do justice to the full detail;\nSo, luckily for both, my phrases fail.\n\nThus much however I may add,—her years\n  Were ripe, they might make six-and-twenty springs;\nBut there are forms which Time to touch forbears,\n  And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things,\nSuch as was Mary's Queen of Scots; true—tears\n  And love destroy; and sapping sorrow wrings\nCharms from the charmer, yet some never grow\nUgly; for instance—Ninon de l'Enclos.\n\nShe spake some words to her attendants, who\n  Composed a choir of girls, ten or a dozen,\nAnd were all clad alike; like Juan, too,\n  Who wore their uniform, by Baba chosen;\nThey form'd a very nymph-like looking crew,\n  Which might have call'd Diana's chorus 'cousin,'\nAs far as outward show may correspond;\nI won't be bail for anything beyond.\n\nThey bow'd obeisance and withdrew, retiring,\n  But not by the same door through which came in\nBaba and Juan, which last stood admiring,\n  At some small distance, all he saw within\nThis strange saloon, much fitted for inspiring\n  Marvel and praise; for both or none things win;\nAnd I must say, I ne'er could see the very\nGreat happiness of the 'Nil Admirari.'\n\n'Not to admire is all the art I know\n  (Plain truth, dear Murray, needs few flowers of speech)\nTo make men happy, or to keep them so'\n  (So take it in the very words of Creech)—\nThus Horace wrote we all know long ago;\n  And thus Pope quotes the precept to re-teach\nFrom his translation; but had none admired,\nWould Pope have sung, or Horace been inspired?\n\nBaba, when all the damsels were withdrawn,\n  Motion'd to Juan to approach, and then\nA second time desired him to kneel down,\n  And kiss the lady's foot; which maxim when\nHe heard repeated, Juan with a frown\n  Drew himself up to his full height again,\nAnd said, 'It grieved him, but he could not stoop\nTo any shoe, unless it shod the Pope.'\n\nBaba, indignant at this ill-timed pride,\n  Made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat\nHe mutter'd (but the last was given aside)\n  About a bow-string—quite in vain; not yet\nWould Juan bend, though 't were to Mahomet's bride:\n  There 's nothing in the world like etiquette\nIn kingly chambers or imperial halls,\nAs also at the race and county balls.\n\nHe stood like Atlas, with a world of words\n  About his ears, and nathless would not bend:\nThe blood of all his line 's Castilian lords\n  Boil'd in his veins, and rather than descend\nTo stain his pedigree a thousand swords\n  A thousand times of him had made an end;\nAt length perceiving the 'foot' could not stand,\nBaba proposed that he should kiss the hand.\n\nHere was an honourable compromise,\n  A half-way house of diplomatic rest,\nWhere they might meet in much more peaceful guise;\n  And Juan now his willingness exprest\nTo use all fit and proper courtesies,\n  Adding, that this was commonest and best,\nFor through the South the custom still commands\nThe gentleman to kiss the lady's hands.\n\nAnd he advanced, though with but a bad grace,\n  Though on more thorough-bred or fairer fingers\nNo lips e'er left their transitory trace;\n  On such as these the lip too fondly lingers,\nAnd for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,\n  As you will see, if she you love shall bring hers\nIn contact; and sometimes even a fair stranger's\nAn almost twelvemonth's constancy endangers.\n\nThe lady eyed him o'er and o'er, and bade\n  Baba retire, which he obey'd in style,\nAs if well used to the retreating trade;\n  And taking hints in good part all the while,\nHe whisper'd Juan not to be afraid,\n  And looking on him with a sort of smile,\nTook leave, with such a face of satisfaction\nAs good men wear who have done a virtuous action.\n\nWhen he was gone, there was a sudden change:\n  I know not what might be the lady's thought,\nBut o'er her bright brow flash'd a tumult strange,\n  And into her dear cheek the blood was brought,\nBlood-red as sunset summer clouds which range\n  The verge of Heaven; and in her large eyes wrought,\nA mixture of sensations might be scann'd,\nOf half voluptuousness and half command.\n\nHer form had all the softness of her sex,\n  Her features all the sweetness of the devil,\nWhen he put on the cherub to perplex\n  Eve, and paved (God knows how) the road to evil;\nThe sun himself was scarce more free from specks\n  Than she from aught at which the eye could cavil;\nYet, somehow, there was something somewhere wanting,\nAs if she rather order'd than was granting.\n\nSomething imperial, or imperious, threw\n  A chain o'er all she did; that is, a chain\nWas thrown as 't were about the neck of you,—\n  And rapture's self will seem almost a pain\nWith aught which looks like despotism in view:\n  Our souls at least are free, and 't is in vain\nWe would against them make the flesh obey—\nThe spirit in the end will have its way.\n\nHer very smile was haughty, though so sweet;\n  Her very nod was not an inclination;\nThere was a self-will even in her small feet,\n  As though they were quite conscious of her station—\nThey trod as upon necks; and to complete\n  Her state (it is the custom of her nation),\nA poniard deck'd her girdle, as the sign\nShe was a sultan's bride (thank Heaven, not mine!).\n\n'To hear and to obey' had been from birth\n  The law of all around her; to fulfill\nAll phantasies which yielded joy or mirth,\n  Had been her slaves' chief pleasure, as her will;\nHer blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth:\n  Judge, then, if her caprices e'er stood still;\nHad she but been a Christian, I 've a notion\nWe should have found out the 'perpetual motion.'\n\nWhate'er she saw and coveted was brought;\n  Whate'er she did not see, if she supposed\nIt might be seen, with diligence was sought,\n  And when 't was found straightway the bargain closed;\nThere was no end unto the things she bought,\n  Nor to the trouble which her fancies caused;\nYet even her tyranny had such a grace,\nThe women pardon'd all except her face.\n\nJuan, the latest of her whims, had caught\n  Her eye in passing on his way to sale;\nShe order'd him directly to be bought,\n  And Baba, who had ne'er been known to fail\nIn any kind of mischief to be wrought,\n  At all such auctions knew how to prevail:\nShe had no prudence, but he had; and this\nExplains the garb which Juan took amiss.\n\nHis youth and features favour'd the disguise,\n  And, should you ask how she, a sultan's bride,\nCould risk or compass such strange phantasies,\n  This I must leave sultanas to decide:\nEmperors are only husbands in wives' eyes,\n  And kings and consorts oft are mystified,\nAs we may ascertain with due precision,\nSome by experience, others by tradition.\n\nBut to the main point, where we have been tending:—\n  She now conceived all difficulties past,\nAnd deem'd herself extremely condescending\n  When, being made her property at last,\nWithout more preface, in her blue eyes blending\n  Passion and power, a glance on him she cast,\nAnd merely saying, 'Christian, canst thou love?'\nConceived that phrase was quite enough to move\n\nAnd so it was, in proper time and place;\n  But Juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing\nWith Haidee's isle and soft Ionian face,\n  Felt the warm blood, which in his face was glowing,\nRush back upon his heart, which fill'd apace,\n  And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing;\nThese words went through his soul like Arab-spears,\nSo that he spoke not, but burst into tears.\n\nShe was a good deal shock'd; not shock'd at tears,\n  For women shed and use them at their liking;\nBut there is something when man's eye appears\n  Wet, still more disagreeable and striking;\nA woman's tear-drop melts, a man's half sears,\n  Like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in\nHis heart to force it out, for (to be shorter)\nTo them 't is a relief, to us a torture.\n\nAnd she would have consoled, but knew not how:\n  Having no equals, nothing which had e'er\nInfected her with sympathy till now,\n  And never having dreamt what 't was to bear\nAught of a serious, sorrowing kind, although\n  There might arise some pouting petty care\nTo cross her brow, she wonder'd how so near\nHer eyes another's eye could shed a tear.\n\nBut nature teaches more than power can spoil,\n  And, when a strong although a strange sensation\nMoves—female hearts are such a genial soil\n  For kinder feelings, whatsoe'er their nation,\nThey naturally pour the 'wine and oil,'\n  Samaritans in every situation;\nAnd thus Gulbeyaz, though she knew not why,\nFelt an odd glistening moisture in her eye.\n\nBut tears must stop like all things else; and soon\n  Juan, who for an instant had been moved\nTo such a sorrow by the intrusive tone\n  Of one who dared to ask if 'he had loved,'\nCall'd back the stoic to his eyes, which shone\n  Bright with the very weakness he reproved;\nAnd although sensitive to beauty, he\nFelt most indignant still at not being free.\n\nGulbeyaz, for the first time in her days,\n  Was much embarrass'd, never having met\nIn all her life with aught save prayers and praise;\n  And as she also risk'd her life to get\nHim whom she meant to tutor in love's ways\n  Into a comfortable tete-a-tete,\nTo lose the hour would make her quite a martyr,\nAnd they had wasted now almost a quarter.\n\nI also would suggest the fitting time\n  To gentlemen in any such like case,\nThat is to say in a meridian clime—\n  With us there is more law given to the chase,\nBut here a small delay forms a great crime:\n  So recollect that the extremest grace\nIs just two minutes for your declaration—\nA moment more would hurt your reputation.\n\nJuan's was good; and might have been still better,\n  But he had got Haidee into his head:\nHowever strange, he could not yet forget her,\n  Which made him seem exceedingly ill-bred.\nGulbeyaz, who look'd on him as her debtor\n  For having had him to her palace led,\nBegan to blush up to the eyes, and then\nGrow deadly pale, and then blush back again.\n\nAt length, in an imperial way, she laid\n  Her hand on his, and bending on him eyes\nWhich needed not an empire to persuade,\n  Look'd into his for love, where none replies:\nHer brow grew black, but she would not upbraid,\n  That being the last thing a proud woman tries;\nShe rose, and pausing one chaste moment, threw\nHerself upon his breast, and there she grew.\n\nThis was an awkward test, as Juan found,\n  But he was steel'd by sorrow, wrath, and pride:\nWith gentle force her white arms he unwound,\n  And seated her all drooping by his side,\nThen rising haughtily he glanced around,\n  And looking coldly in her face, he cried,\n'The prison'd eagle will not pair, nor\nServe a Sultana's sensual phantasy.\n\n'Thou ask'st if I can love? be this the proof\n  How much I have loved—that I love not thee!\nIn this vile garb, the distaff, web, and woof,\n  Were fitter for me: Love is for the free!\nI am not dazzled by this splendid roof,\n  Whate'er thy power, and great it seems to be;\nHeads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne,\nAnd hands obey—our hearts are still our own.'\n\nThis was a truth to us extremely trite;\n  Not so to her, who ne'er had heard such things:\nShe deem'd her least command must yield delight,\n  Earth being only made for queens and kings.\nIf hearts lay on the left side or the right\n  She hardly knew, to such perfection brings\nLegitimacy its born votaries, when\nAware of their due royal rights o'er men.\n\nBesides, as has been said, she was so fair\n  As even in a much humbler lot had made\nA kingdom or confusion anywhere,\n  And also, as may be presumed, she laid\nSome stress on charms, which seldom are, if e'er,\n  By their possessors thrown into the shade:\nShe thought hers gave a double 'right divine;'\nAnd half of that opinion 's also mine.\n\nRemember, or (if you can not) imagine,\n  Ye, who have kept your chastity when young,\nWhile some more desperate dowager has been waging\n  Love with you, and been in the dog-days stung\nBy your refusal, recollect her raging!\n  Or recollect all that was said or sung\nOn such a subject; then suppose the face\nOf a young downright beauty in this case.\n\nSuppose,—but you already have supposed,\n  The spouse of Potiphar, the Lady Booby,\nPhaedra, and all which story has disclosed\n  Of good examples; pity that so few by\nPoets and private tutors are exposed,\n  To educate—ye youth of Europe—you by!\nBut when you have supposed the few we know,\nYou can't suppose Gulbeyaz' angry brow.\n\nA tigress robb'd of young, a lioness,\n  Or any interesting beast of prey,\nAre similes at hand for the distress\n  Of ladies who can not have their own way;\nBut though my turn will not be served with less,\n  These don't express one half what I should say:\nFor what is stealing young ones, few or many,\nTo cutting short their hopes of having any?\n\nThe love of offspring 's nature's general law,\n  From tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings;\nThere 's nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw\n  Like an invasion of their babes and sucklings;\nAnd all who have seen a human nursery, saw\n  How mothers love their children's squalls and chucklings;\nThis strong extreme effect (to tire no longer\nYour patience) shows the cause must still be stronger.\n\nIf I said fire flash'd from Gulbeyaz' eyes,\n  'T were nothing—for her eyes flash'd always fire;\nOr said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes,\n  I should but bring disgrace upon the dyer,\nSo supernatural was her passion's rise;\n  For ne'er till now she knew a check'd desire:\nEven ye who know what a check'd woman is\n(Enough, God knows!) would much fall short of this.\n\nHer rage was but a minute's, and 't was well—\n  A moment's more had slain her; but the while\nIt lasted 't was like a short glimpse of hell:\n  Nought 's more sublime than energetic bile,\nThough horrible to see yet grand to tell,\n  Like ocean warring 'gainst a rocky isle;\nAnd the deep passions flashing through her form\nMade her a beautiful embodied storm.\n\nA vulgar tempest 't were to a typhoon\n  To match a common fury with her rage,\nAnd yet she did not want to reach the moon,\n  Like moderate Hotspur on the immortal page;\nHer anger pitch'd into a lower tune,\n  Perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age—\nHer wish was but to 'kill, kill, kill,' like Lear's,\nAnd then her thirst of blood was quench'd in tears.\n\nA storm it raged, and like the storm it pass'd,\n  Pass'd without words—in fact she could not speak;\nAnd then her sex's shame broke in at last,\n  A sentiment till then in her but weak,\nBut now it flow'd in natural and fast,\n  As water through an unexpected leak;\nFor she felt humbled—and humiliation\nIs sometimes good for people in her station\n\nIt teaches them that they are flesh and blood,\n  It also gently hints to them that others,\nAlthough of clay, are yet not quite of mud;\n  That urns and pipkins are but fragile brothers,\nAnd works of the same pottery, bad or good,\n  Though not all born of the same sires and mothers:\nIt teaches—Heaven knows only what it teaches,\nBut sometimes it may mend, and often reaches.\n\nHer first thought was to cut off Juan's head;\n  Her second, to cut only his—acquaintance;\nHer third, to ask him where he had been bred;\n  Her fourth, to rally him into repentance;\nHer fifth, to call her maids and go to bed;\n  Her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence\nThe lash to Baba:—but her grand resource\nWas to sit down again, and cry of course.\n\nShe thought to stab herself, but then she had\n  The dagger close at hand, which made it awkward;\nFor Eastern stays are little made to pad,\n  So that a poniard pierces if 't is stuck hard:\nShe thought of killing Juan—but, poor lad!\n  Though he deserved it well for being so backward,\nThe cutting off his head was not the art\nMost likely to attain her aim—his heart.\n\nJuan was moved; he had made up his mind\n  To be impaled, or quarter'd as a dish\nFor dogs, or to be slain with pangs refined,\n  Or thrown to lions, or made baits for fish,\nAnd thus heroically stood resign'd,\n  Rather than sin—except to his own wish:\nBut all his great preparatives for dying\nDissolved like snow before a woman crying.\n\nAs through his palms Bob Acres' valour oozed,\n  So Juan's virtue ebb'd, I know not how;\nAnd first he wonder'd why he had refused;\n  And then, if matters could be made up now;\nAnd next his savage virtue he accused,\n  Just as a friar may accuse his vow,\nOr as a dame repents her of her oath,\nWhich mostly ends in some small breach of both.\n\nSo he began to stammer some excuses;\n  But words are not enough in such a matter,\nAlthough you borrow'd all that e'er the muses\n  Have sung, or even a Dandy's dandiest chatter,\nOr all the figures Castlereagh abuses;\n  Just as a languid smile began to flatter\nHis peace was making, but before he ventured\nFurther, old Baba rather briskly enter'd.\n\n'Bride of the Sun! and Sister of the Moon!'\n  ('T was thus he spake) 'and Empress of the Earth!\nWhose frown would put the spheres all out of tune,\n  Whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth,\nYour slave brings tidings—he hopes not too soon—\n  Which your sublime attention may be worth:\nThe Sun himself has sent me like a ray,\nTo hint that he is coming up this way.'\n\n'Is it,' exclaim'd Gulbeyaz, 'as you say?\n  I wish to heaven he would not shine till morning!\nBut bid my women form the milky way.\n  Hence, my old comet! give the stars due warning—\nAnd, Christian! mingle with them as you may,\n  And as you 'd have me pardon your past scorning-'\nHere they were interrupted by a humming\nSound, and then by a cry, 'The Sultan 's coming!'\n\nFirst came her damsels, a decorous file,\n  And then his Highness' eunuchs, black and white;\nThe train might reach a quarter of a mile:\n  His majesty was always so polite\nAs to announce his visits a long while\n  Before he came, especially at night;\nFor being the last wife of the Emperour,\nShe was of course the favorite of the four.\n\nHis Highness was a man of solemn port,\n  Shawl'd to the nose, and bearded to the eyes,\nSnatch'd from a prison to preside at court,\n  His lately bowstrung brother caused his rise;\nHe was as good a sovereign of the sort\n  As any mention'd in the histories\nOf Cantemir, or Knolles, where few shine\nSave Solyman, the glory of their line.\n\nHe went to mosque in state, and said his prayers\n  With more than 'Oriental scrupulosity;'\nHe left to his vizier all state affairs,\n  And show'd but little royal curiosity:\nI know not if he had domestic cares—\n  No process proved connubial animosity;\nFour wives and twice five hundred maids, unseen,\nWere ruled as calmly as a Christian queen.\n\nIf now and then there happen'd a slight slip,\n  Little was heard of criminal or crime;\nThe story scarcely pass'd a single lip—\n  The sack and sea had settled all in time,\nFrom which the secret nobody could rip:\n  The Public knew no more than does this rhyme;\nNo scandals made the daily press a curse—\nMorals were better, and the fish no worse.\n\nHe saw with his own eyes the moon was round,\n  Was also certain that the earth was square,\nBecause he had journey'd fifty miles, and found\n  No sign that it was circular anywhere;\nHis empire also was without a bound:\n  'T is true, a little troubled here and there,\nBy rebel pachas, and encroaching giaours,\nBut then they never came to 'the Seven Towers;'\n\nExcept in shape of envoys, who were sent\n  To lodge there when a war broke out, according\nTo the true law of nations, which ne'er meant\n  Those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in\nTheir dirty diplomatic hands, to vent\n  Their spleen in making strife, and safely wording\nTheir lies, yclep'd despatches, without risk or\nThe singeing of a single inky whisker.\n\nHe had fifty daughters and four dozen sons,\n  Of whom all such as came of age were stow'd,\nThe former in a palace, where like nuns\n  They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad,\nWhen she, whose turn it was, was wed at once,\n  Sometimes at six years old—though it seems odd,\n'T is true; the reason is, that the Bashaw\nMust make a present to his sire in law.\n\nHis sons were kept in prison, till they grew\n  Of years to fill a bowstring or the throne,\nOne or the other, but which of the two\n  Could yet be known unto the fates alone;\nMeantime the education they went through\n  Was princely, as the proofs have always shown:\nSo that the heir apparent still was found\nNo less deserving to be hang'd than crown'd.\n\nHis majesty saluted his fourth spouse\n  With all the ceremonies of his rank,\nWho clear'd her sparkling eyes and smooth'd her brows,\n  As suits a matron who has play'd a prank;\nThese must seem doubly mindful of their vows,\n  To save the credit of their breaking bank:\nTo no men are such cordial greetings given\nAs those whose wives have made them fit for heaven.\n\nHis Highness cast around his great black eyes,\n  And looking, as he always look'd, perceived\nJuan amongst the damsels in disguise,\n  At which he seem'd no whit surprised nor grieved,\nBut just remark'd with air sedate and wise,\n  While still a fluttering sigh Gulbeyaz heaved,\n'I see you 've bought another girl; 't is pity\nThat a mere Christian should be half so pretty.'\n\nThis compliment, which drew all eyes upon\n  The new-bought virgin, made her blush and shake.\nHer comrades, also, thought themselves undone:\n  O! Mahomet! that his majesty should take\nSuch notice of a giaour, while scarce to one\n  Of them his lips imperial ever spake!\nThere was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle,\nBut etiquette forbade them all to giggle.\n\nThe Turks do well to shut—at least, sometimes—\n  The women up, because, in sad reality,\nTheir chastity in these unhappy climes\n  Is not a thing of that astringent quality\nWhich in the North prevents precocious crimes,\n  And makes our snow less pure than our morality;\nThe sun, which yearly melts the polar ice,\nHas quite the contrary effect on vice.\n\nThus in the East they are extremely strict,\n  And Wedlock and a Padlock mean the same;\nExcepting only when the former 's pick'd\n  It ne'er can be replaced in proper frame;\nSpoilt, as a pipe of claret is when prick'd:\n  But then their own Polygamy 's to blame;\nWhy don't they knead two virtuous souls for life\nInto that moral centaur, man and wife?\n\nThus far our chronicle; and now we pause,\n  Though not for want of matter; but 't is time\nAccording to the ancient epic laws,\n  To slacken sail, and anchor with our rhyme.\nLet this fifth canto meet with due applause,\n  The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime;\nMeanwhile, as Homer sometimes sleeps, perhaps\nYou 'll pardon to my muse a few short naps.</code>"

God is love, they say,\n  And Love 's a god, or was before the brow\nOf earth was wrinkled by the sins and tears\nOf—but Chronology best knows the years.\n\nWe left our hero and third heroine in\n  A kind of state more awkward than uncommon,\nFor gentlemen must sometimes risk their skin\n  For that sad tempter, a forbidden woman:\nSultans too much abhor this sort of sin,\n  And don't agree at all with the wise Roman,\nHeroic, stoic Cato, the sententious,\nWho lent his lady to his friend Hortensius.\n\nI know Gulbeyaz was extremely wrong;\n  I own it, I deplore it, I condemn it;\nBut I detest all fiction even in song,\n  And so must tell the truth, howe'er you blame it.\nHer reason being weak, her passions strong,\n  She thought that her lord's heart (even could she claim it)\nWas scarce enough; for he had fifty-nine\nYears, and a fifteen-hundredth concubine.\n\nI am not, like Cassio, 'an arithmetician,'\n  But by 'the bookish theoric' it appears,\nIf 'tis summ'd up with feminine precision,\n  That, adding to the account his Highness' years,\nThe fair Sultana err'd from inanition;\n  For, were the Sultan just to all his dears,\nShe could but claim the fifteen-hundredth part\nOf what should be monopoly—the heart.\n\nIt is observed that ladies are litigious\n  Upon all legal objects of possession,\nAnd not the least so when they are religious,\n  Which doubles what they think of the transgression:\nWith suits and prosecutions they besiege us,\n  As the tribunals show through many a session,\nWhen they suspect that any one goes shares\nIn that to which the law makes them sole heirs.\n\nNow, if this holds good in a Christian land,\n  The heathen also, though with lesser latitude,\nAre apt to carry things with a high hand,\n  And take what kings call 'an imposing attitude,'\nAnd for their rights connubial make a stand,\n  When their liege husbands treat them with ingratitude:\nAnd as four wives must have quadruple claims,\nThe Tigris hath its jealousies like Thames.\n\nGulbeyaz was the fourth, and (as I said)\n  The favourite; but what 's favour amongst four?\nPolygamy may well be held in dread,\n  Not only as a sin, but as a bore:\nMost wise men, with one moderate woman wed,\n  Will scarcely find philosophy for more;\nAnd all (except Mahometans) forbear\nTo make the nuptial couch a 'Bed of Ware.'\n\nHis Highness, the sublimest of mankind,—\n  So styled according to the usual forms\nOf every monarch, till they are consign'd\n  To those sad hungry jacobins the worms,\nWho on the very loftiest kings have dined,—\n  His Highness gazed upon Gulbeyaz' charms,\nExpecting all the welcome of a lover\n(A 'Highland welcome' all the wide world over).\n\nNow here we should distinguish; for howe'er\n  Kisses, sweet words, embraces, and all that,\nMay look like what is—neither here nor there,\n  They are put on as easily as a hat,\nOr rather bonnet, which the fair sex wear,\n  Trimm'd either heads or hearts to decorate,\nWhich form an ornament, but no more part\nOf heads, than their caresses of the heart.\n\nA slight blush, a soft tremor, a calm kind\n  Of gentle feminine delight, and shown\nMore in the eyelids than the eyes, resign'd\n  Rather to hide what pleases most unknown,\nAre the best tokens (to a modest mind)\n  Of love, when seated on his loveliest throne,\nA sincere woman's breast,—for over-warm\nOr over-cold annihilates the charm.\n\nFor over-warmth, if false, is worse than truth;\n  If true, 'tis no great lease of its own fire;\nFor no one, save in very early youth,\n  Would like (I think) to trust all to desire,\nWhich is but a precarious bond, in sooth,\n  And apt to be transferr'd to the first buyer\nAt a sad discount: while your over chilly\nWomen, on t' other hand, seem somewhat silly.\n\nThat is, we cannot pardon their bad taste,\n  For so it seems to lovers swift or slow,\nWho fain would have a mutual flame confess'd,\n  And see a sentimental passion glow,\nEven were St. Francis' paramour their guest,\n  In his monastic concubine of snow;—\nIn short, the maxim for the amorous tribe is\nHoratian, 'Medio tu tutissimus ibis.'\n\nThe 'tu' 's too much,—but let it stand,—the verse\n  Requires it, that 's to say, the English rhyme,\nAnd not the pink of old hexameters;\n  But, after all, there 's neither tune nor time\nIn the last line, which cannot well be worse,\n  And was thrust in to close the octave's chime:\nI own no prosody can ever rate it\nAs a rule, but truth may, if you translate it.\n\nIf fair Gulbeyaz overdid her part,\n  I know not—it succeeded, and success\nIs much in most things, not less in the heart\n  Than other articles of female dress.\nSelf-love in man, too, beats all female art;\n  They lie, we lie, all lie, but love no less;\nAnd no one virtue yet, except starvation,\nCould stop that worst of vices—propagation.\n\nWe leave this royal couple to repose:\n  A bed is not a throne, and they may sleep,\nWhate'er their dreams be, if of joys or woes:\n  Yet disappointed joys are woes as deep\nAs any man's day mixture undergoes.\n  Our least of sorrows are such as we weep;\n'Tis the vile daily drop on drop which wears\nThe soul out (like the stone) with petty cares.\n\nA scolding wife, a sullen son, a bill\n  To pay, unpaid, protested, or discounted\nAt a per-centage; a child cross, dog ill,\n  A favourite horse fallen lame just as he 's mounted,\nA bad old woman making a worse will,\n  Which leaves you minus of the cash you counted\nAs certain;—these are paltry things, and yet\nI 've rarely seen the man they did not fret.\n\nI 'm a philosopher; confound them all!\n  Bills, beasts, and men, and—no! not womankind!\nWith one good hearty curse I vent my gall,\n  And then my stoicism leaves nought behind\nWhich it can either pain or evil call,\n  And I can give my whole soul up to mind;\nThough what is soul or mind, their birth or growth,\nIs more than I know—the deuce take them both!\n\n  As after reading Athanasius' curse,\nWhich doth your true believer so much please:\n  I doubt if any now could make it worse\nO'er his worst enemy when at his knees,\n  'Tis so sententious, positive, and terse,\nAnd decorates the book of Common Prayer,\nAs doth a rainbow the just clearing air.\n\nGulbeyaz and her lord were sleeping, or\n  At least one of them!—Oh, the heavy night,\nWhen wicked wives, who love some bachelor,\n  Lie down in dudgeon to sigh for the light\nOf the gray morning, and look vainly for\n  Its twinkle through the lattice dusky quite—\nTo toss, to tumble, doze, revive, and quake\nLest their too lawful bed-fellow should wake!\n\nThese are beneath the canopy of heaven,\n  Also beneath the canopy of beds\nFour-posted and silk curtain'd, which are given\n  For rich men and their brides to lay their heads\nUpon, in sheets white as what bards call 'driven\n  Snow.' Well! 'tis all hap-hazard when one weds.\nGulbeyaz was an empress, but had been\nPerhaps as wretched if a peasant's quean.\n\nDon Juan in his feminine disguise,\n  With all the damsels in their long array,\nHad bow'd themselves before th' imperial eyes,\n  And at the usual signal ta'en their way\nBack to their chambers, those long galleries\n  In the seraglio, where the ladies lay\nTheir delicate limbs; a thousand bosoms there\nBeating for love, as the caged bird's for air.\n\nI love the sex, and sometimes would reverse\n  The tyrant's wish, 'that mankind only had\nOne neck, which he with one fell stroke might pierce:'\n  My wish is quite as wide, but not so bad,\nAnd much more tender on the whole than fierce;\n  It being (not now, but only while a lad)\nThat womankind had but one rosy mouth,\nTo kiss them all at once from North to South.\n\nO, enviable Briareus! with thy hands\n  And heads, if thou hadst all things multiplied\nIn such proportion!—But my Muse withstands\n  The giant thought of being a Titan's bride,\nOr travelling in Patagonian lands;\n  So let us back to Lilliput, and guide\nOur hero through the labyrinth of love\nIn which we left him several lines above.\n\nHe went forth with the lovely Odalisques,\n  At the given signal join'd to their array;\nAnd though he certainly ran many risks,\n  Yet he could not at times keep, by the way\n(Although the consequences of such frisks\n  Are worse than the worst damages men pay\nIn moral England, where the thing 's a tax),\nFrom ogling all their charms from breasts to backs.\n\nStill he forgot not his disguise:—along\n  The galleries from room to room they walk'd,\nA virgin-like and edifying throng,\n  By eunuchs flank'd; while at their head there stalk'd\nA dame who kept up discipline among\n  The female ranks, so that none stirr'd or talk'd\nWithout her sanction on their she-parades:\nHer title was 'the Mother of the Maids.'\n\nWhether she was a 'mother,' I know not,\n  Or whether they were 'maids' who call'd her mother;\nBut this is her seraglio title, got\n  I know not how, but good as any other;\nSo Cantemir can tell you, or De Tott:\n  Her office was to keep aloof or smother\nAll bad propensities in fifteen hundred\nYoung women, and correct them when they blunder'd.\n\nA goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made\n  More easy by the absence of all men—\nExcept his majesty, who, with her aid,\n  And guards, and bolts, and walls, and now and then\nA slight example, just to cast a shade\n  Along the rest, contrived to keep this den\nOf beauties cool as an Italian convent,\nWhere all the passions have, alas! but one vent.\n\nAnd what is that? Devotion, doubtless—how\n  Could you ask such a question?—but we will\nContinue. As I said, this goodly row\n  Of ladies of all countries at the will\nOf one good man, with stately march and slow,\n  Like water-lilies floating down a rill—\nOr rather lake, for rills do not run slowly—\nPaced on most maiden-like and melancholy.\n\nBut when they reach'd their own apartments, there,\n  Like birds, or boys, or bedlamites broke loose,\nWaves at spring-tide, or women anywhere\n  When freed from bonds (which are of no great use\nAfter all), or like Irish at a fair,\n  Their guards being gone, and as it were a truce\nEstablish'd between them and bondage, they\nBegan to sing, dance, chatter, smile, and play.\n\nTheir talk, of course, ran most on the new comer;\n  Her shape, her hair, her air, her everything:\nSome thought her dress did not so much become her,\n  Or wonder'd at her ears without a ring;\nSome said her years were getting nigh their summer,\n  Others contended they were but in spring;\nSome thought her rather masculine in height,\nWhile others wish'd that she had been so quite.\n\nBut no one doubted on the whole, that she\n  Was what her dress bespoke, a damsel fair,\nAnd fresh, and 'beautiful exceedingly,'\n  Who with the brightest Georgians might compare:\nThey wonder'd how Gulbeyaz, too, could be\n  So silly as to buy slaves who might share\n(If that his Highness wearied of his bride)\nHer throne and power, and every thing beside.\n\nBut what was strangest in this virgin crew,\n  Although her beauty was enough to vex,\nAfter the first investigating view,\n  They all found out as few, or fewer, specks\nIn the fair form of their companion new,\n  Than is the custom of the gentle sex,\nWhen they survey, with Christian eyes or Heathen,\nIn a new face 'the ugliest creature breathing.'\n\nAnd yet they had their little jealousies,\n  Like all the rest; but upon this occasion,\nWhether there are such things as sympathies\n  Without our knowledge or our approbation,\nAlthough they could not see through his disguise,\n  All felt a soft kind of concatenation,\nLike magnetism, or devilism, or what\nYou please—we will not quarrel about that:\n\nBut certain 'tis they all felt for their new\n  Companion something newer still, as 'twere\nA sentimental friendship through and through,\n  Extremely pure, which made them all concur\nIn wishing her their sister, save a few\n  Who wish'd they had a brother just like her,\nWhom, if they were at home in sweet Circassia,\nThey would prefer to Padisha or Pacha.\n\nOf those who had most genius for this sort\n  Of sentimental friendship, there were three,\nLolah, Katinka, and Dudu; in short\n  (To save description), fair as fair can be\nWere they, according to the best report,\n  Though differing in stature and degree,\nAnd clime and time, and country and complexion;\nThey all alike admired their new connection.\n\nLolah was dusk as India and as warm;\n  Katinka was a Georgian, white and red,\nWith great blue eyes, a lovely hand and arm,\n  And feet so small they scarce seem'd made to tread,\nBut rather skim the earth; while Dudu's form\n  Look'd more adapted to be put to bed,\nBeing somewhat large, and languishing, and lazy,\nYet of a beauty that would drive you crazy.\n\nA kind of sleepy Venus seem'd Dudu,\n  Yet very fit to 'murder sleep' in those\nWho gazed upon her cheek's transcendent hue,\n  Her Attic forehead, and her Phidian nose:\nFew angles were there in her form, 'tis true,\n  Thinner she might have been, and yet scarce lose;\nYet, after all, 'twould puzzle to say where\nIt would not spoil some separate charm to pare.\n\nShe was not violently lively, but\n  Stole on your spirit like a May-day breaking;\nHer eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half-shut,\n  They put beholders in a tender taking;\nShe look'd (this simile 's quite new) just cut\n  From marble, like Pygmalion's statue waking,\nThe mortal and the marble still at strife,\nAnd timidly expanding into life.\n\nLolah demanded the new damsel's name—\n  'Juanna.'—Well, a pretty name enough.\nKatinka ask'd her also whence she came—\n  'From Spain.'—'But where is Spain?'—'Don't ask such stuff,\nNor show your Georgian ignorance—for shame!'\n  Said Lolah, with an accent rather rough,\nTo poor Katinka: 'Spain 's an island near\nMorocco, betwixt Egypt and Tangier.'\n\nDudu said nothing, but sat down beside\n  Juanna, playing with her veil or hair;\nAnd looking at her steadfastly, she sigh'd,\n  As if she pitied her for being there,\nA pretty stranger without friend or guide,\n  And all abash'd, too, at the general stare\nWhich welcomes hapless strangers in all places,\nWith kind remarks upon their mien and faces.\n\nBut here the Mother of the Maids drew near,\n  With, 'Ladies, it is time to go to rest.\nI 'm puzzled what to do with you, my dear,'\n  She added to Juanna, their new guest:\n'Your coming has been unexpected here,\n  And every couch is occupied; you had best\nPartake of mine; but by to-morrow early\nWe will have all things settled for you fairly.'\n\nHere Lolah interposed—'Mamma, you know\n  You don't sleep soundly, and I cannot bear\nThat anybody should disturb you so;\n  I 'll take Juanna; we 're a slenderer pair\nThan you would make the half of;—don't say no;\n  And I of your young charge will take due care.'\nBut here Katinka interfered, and said,\n'She also had compassion and a bed.\n\n'Besides, I hate to sleep alone,' quoth she.\n  The matron frown'd: 'Why so?'—'For fear of ghosts,'\nReplied Katinka; 'I am sure I see\n  A phantom upon each of the four posts;\nAnd then I have the worst dreams that can be,\n  Of Guebres, Giaours, and Ginns, and Gouls in hosts.'\nThe dame replied, 'Between your dreams and you,\nI fear Juanna's dreams would be but few.\n\n'You, Lolah, must continue still to lie\n  Alone, for reasons which don't matter; you\nThe same, Katinka, until by and by;\n  And I shall place Juanna with Dudu,\nWho 's quiet, inoffensive, silent, shy,\n  And will not toss and chatter the night through.\nWhat say you, child?'—Dudu said nothing, as\nHer talents were of the more silent class;\n\nBut she rose up, and kiss'd the matron's brow\n  Between the eyes, and Lolah on both cheeks,\nKatinka, too; and with a gentle bow\n  (Curt'sies are neither used by Turks nor Greeks)\nShe took Juanna by the hand to show\n  Their place of rest, and left to both their piques,\nThe others pouting at the matron's preference\nOf Dudu, though they held their tongues from deference.\n\nIt was a spacious chamber (Oda is\n  The Turkish title), and ranged round the wall\nWere couches, toilets—and much more than this\n  I might describe, as I have seen it all,\nBut it suffices—little was amiss;\n  'Twas on the whole a nobly furnish'd hall,\nWith all things ladies want, save one or two,\nAnd even those were nearer than they knew.\n\nDudu, as has been said, was a sweet creature,\n  Not very dashing, but extremely winning,\nWith the most regulated charms of feature,\n  Which painters cannot catch like faces sinning\nAgainst proportion—the wild strokes of nature\n  Which they hit off at once in the beginning,\nFull of expression, right or wrong, that strike,\nAnd pleasing or unpleasing, still are like.\n\nBut she was a soft landscape of mild earth,\n  Where all was harmony, and calm, and quiet,\nLuxuriant, budding; cheerful without mirth,\n  Which, if not happiness, is much more nigh it\nThan are your mighty passions and so forth,\n  Which some call 'the sublime:' I wish they 'd try it:\nI 've seen your stormy seas and stormy women,\nAnd pity lovers rather more than seamen.\n\nBut she was pensive more than melancholy,\n  And serious more than pensive, and serene,\nIt may be, more than either—not unholy\n  Her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been.\nThe strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly\n  Unconscious, albeit turn'd of quick seventeen,\nThat she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;\nShe never thought about herself at all.\n\nAnd therefore was she kind and gentle as\n  The Age of Gold (when gold was yet unknown,\nBy which its nomenclature came to pass;\n  Thus most appropriately has been shown\n'Lucus a non lucendo,' not what was,\n  But what was not; a sort of style that 's grown\nExtremely common in this age, whose metal\nThe devil may decompose, but never settle:\n\nI think it may be of 'Corinthian Brass,'\n  Which was a mixture of all metals, but\nThe brazen uppermost). Kind reader! pass\n  This long parenthesis: I could not shut\nIt sooner for the soul of me, and class\n  My faults even with your own! which meaneth, Put\nA kind construction upon them and me:\nBut that you won't—then don't—I am not less free.\n\n'Tis time we should return to plain narration,\n  And thus my narrative proceeds:—Dudu,\nWith every kindness short of ostentation,\n  Show'd Juan, or Juanna, through and through\nThis labyrinth of females, and each station\n  Described—what 's strange—in words extremely few:\nI have but one simile, and that 's a blunder,\nFor wordless woman, which is silent thunder.\n\nAnd next she gave her (I say her, because\n  The gender still was epicene, at least\nIn outward show, which is a saving clause)\n  An outline of the customs of the East,\nWith all their chaste integrity of laws,\n  By which the more a haram is increased,\nThe stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties\nOf any supernumerary beauties.\n\nAnd then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:\n  Dudu was fond of kissing—which I 'm sure\nThat nobody can ever take amiss,\n  Because 'tis pleasant, so that it be pure,\nAnd between females means no more than this—\n  That they have nothing better near, or newer.\n'Kiss' rhymes to 'bliss' in fact as well as verse—\nI wish it never led to something worse.\n\nIn perfect innocence she then unmade\n  Her toilet, which cost little, for she was\nA child of Nature, carelessly array'd:\n  If fond of a chance ogle at her glass,\n'Twas like the fawn, which, in the lake display'd,\n  Beholds her own shy, shadowy image pass,\nWhen first she starts, and then returns to peep,\nAdmiring this new native of the deep.\n\nAnd one by one her articles of dress\n  Were laid aside; but not before she offer'd\nHer aid to fair Juanna, whose excess\n  Of modesty declined the assistance proffer'd:\nWhich pass'd well off—as she could do no less;\n  Though by this politesse she rather suffer'd,\nPricking her fingers with those cursed pins,\nWhich surely were invented for our sins,—\n\nMaking a woman like a porcupine,\n  Not to be rashly touch'd. But still more dread,\nO ye! whose fate it is, as once 'twas mine,\n  In early youth, to turn a lady's maid;—\nI did my very boyish best to shine\n  In tricking her out for a masquerade;\nThe pins were placed sufficiently, but not\nStuck all exactly in the proper spot.\n\nBut these are foolish things to all the wise,\n  And I love wisdom more than she loves me;\nMy tendency is to philosophise\n  On most things, from a tyrant to a tree;\nBut still the spouseless virgin Knowledge flies.\n  What are we? and whence came we? what shall be\nOur ultimate existence? what 's our present?\nAre questions answerless, and yet incessant.\n\nThere was deep silence in the chamber: dim\n  And distant from each other burn'd the lights,\nAnd slumber hover'd o'er each lovely limb\n  Of the fair occupants: if there be sprites,\nThey should have walk'd there in their sprightliest trim,\n  By way of change from their sepulchral sites,\nAnd shown themselves as ghosts of better taste\nThan haunting some old ruin or wild waste.\n\nMany and beautiful lay those around,\n  Like flowers of different hue, and dime, and root,\nIn some exotic garden sometimes found,\n  With cost, and care, and warmth induced to shoot.\nOne with her auburn tresses lightly bound,\n  And fair brows gently drooping, as the fruit\nNods from the tree, was slumbering with soft breath,\nAnd lips apart, which show'd the pearls beneath.\n\nOne with her flush'd cheek laid on her white arm,\n  And raven ringlets gather'd in dark crowd\nAbove her brow, lay dreaming soft and warm;\n  And smiling through her dream, as through a cloud\nThe moon breaks, half unveil'd each further charm,\n  As, slightly stirring in her snowy shroud,\nHer beauties seized the unconscious hour of night\nAll bashfully to struggle into light.\n\nThis is no bull, although it sounds so; for\n  'Twas night, but there were lamps, as hath been said.\nA third's all pallid aspect offer'd more\n  The traits of sleeping sorrow, and betray'd\nThrough the heaved breast the dream of some far shore\n  Beloved and deplored; while slowly stray'd\n(As night-dew, on a cypress glittering, tinges\nThe black bough) tear-drops through her eyes' dark fringes.\n\nA fourth as marble, statue-like and still,\n  Lay in a breathless, hush'd, and stony sleep;\nWhite, cold, and pure, as looks a frozen rill,\n  Or the snow minaret on an Alpine steep,\nOr Lot's wife done in salt,—or what you will;—\n  My similes are gather'd in a heap,\nSo pick and choose—perhaps you 'll be content\nWith a carved lady on a monument.\n\nAnd lo! a fifth appears;—and what is she?\n  A lady of a 'certain age,' which means\nCertainly aged—what her years might be\n  I know not, never counting past their teens;\nBut there she slept, not quite so fair to see,\n  As ere that awful period intervenes\nWhich lays both men and women on the shelf,\nTo meditate upon their sins and self.\n\nBut all this time how slept, or dream'd, Dudu?\n  With strict inquiry I could ne'er discover,\nAnd scorn to add a syllable untrue;\n  But ere the middle watch was hardly over,\nJust when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,\n  And phantoms hover'd, or might seem to hover,\nTo those who like their company, about\nThe apartment, on a sudden she scream'd out:\n\nAnd that so loudly, that upstarted all\n  The Oda, in a general commotion:\nMatron and maids, and those whom you may call\n  Neither, came crowding like the waves of ocean,\nOne on the other, throughout the whole hall,\n  All trembling, wondering, without the least notion\nMore than I have myself of what could make\nThe calm Dudu so turbulently wake.\n\nBut wide awake she was, and round her bed,\n  With floating draperies and with flying hair,\nWith eager eyes, and light but hurried tread,\n  And bosoms, arms, and ankles glancing bare,\nAnd bright as any meteor ever bred\n  By the North Pole,—they sought her cause of care,\nFor she seem'd agitated, flush'd, and frighten'd,\nHer eye dilated and her colour heighten'd.\n\nBut what was strange—and a strong proof how great\n  A blessing is sound sleep—Juanna lay\nAs fast as ever husband by his mate\n  In holy matrimony snores away.\nNot all the clamour broke her happy state\n  Of slumber, ere they shook her,—so they say\nAt least,—and then she, too, unclosed her eyes,\nAnd yawn'd a good deal with discreet surprise.\n\nAnd now commenced a strict investigation,\n  Which, as all spoke at once and more than once,\nConjecturing, wondering, asking a narration,\n  Alike might puzzle either wit or dunce\nTo answer in a very clear oration.\n  Dudu had never pass'd for wanting sense,\nBut, being 'no orator as Brutus is,'\nCould not at first expound what was amiss.\n\nAt length she said, that in a slumber sound\n  She dream'd a dream, of walking in a wood—\nA 'wood obscure,' like that where Dante found\n  Himself in at the age when all grow good;\nLife's half-way house, where dames with virtue crown'd\n  Run much less risk of lovers turning rude;\nAnd that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,\nAnd trees of goodly growth and spreading roots;\n\nAnd in the midst a golden apple grew,—\n  A most prodigious pippin,—but it hung\nRather too high and distant; that she threw\n  Her glances on it, and then, longing, flung\nStones and whatever she could pick up, to\n  Bring down the fruit, which still perversely clung\nTo its own bough, and dangled yet in sight,\nBut always at a most provoking height;—\n\nThat on a sudden, when she least had hope,\n  It fell down of its own accord before\nHer feet; that her first movement was to stoop\n  And pick it up, and bite it to the core;\nThat just as her young lip began to ope\n  Upon the golden fruit the vision bore,\nA bee flew out and stung her to the heart,\nAnd so—she awoke with a great scream and start.\n\nAll this she told with some confusion and\n  Dismay, the usual consequence of dreams\nOf the unpleasant kind, with none at hand\n  To expound their vain and visionary gleams.\nI 've known some odd ones which seem'd really plann'd\n  Prophetically, or that which one deems\nA 'strange coincidence,' to use a phrase\nBy which such things are settled now-a-days.\n\nThe damsels, who had thoughts of some great harm,\n  Began, as is the consequence of fear,\nTo scold a little at the false alarm\n  That broke for nothing on their sleeping car.\nThe matron, too, was wroth to leave her warm\n  Bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear,\nAnd chafed at poor Dudu, who only sigh'd,\nAnd said that she was sorry she had cried.\n\n'I 've heard of stories of a cock and bull;\n  But visions of an apple and a bee,\nTo take us from our natural rest, and pull\n  The whole Oda from their beds at half-past three,\nWould make us think the moon is at its full.\n  You surely are unwell, child! we must see,\nTo-morrow, what his Highness's physician\nWill say to this hysteric of a vision.\n\n'And poor Juanna, too—the child's first night\n  Within these walls to be broke in upon\nWith such a clamour! I had thought it right\n  That the young stranger should not lie alone,\nAnd, as the quietest of all, she might\n  With you, Dudu, a good night's rest have known;\nBut now I must transfer her to the charge\nOf Lolah—though her couch is not so large.'\n\nLolah's eyes sparkled at the proposition;\n  But poor Dudu, with large drops in her own,\nResulting from the scolding or the vision,\n  Implored that present pardon might be shown\nFor this first fault, and that on no condition\n  (She added in a soft and piteous tone)\nJuanna should be taken from her, and\nHer future dreams should all be kept in hand.\n\nShe promised never more to have a dream,\n  At least to dream so loudly as just now;\nShe wonder'd at herself how she could scream—\n  'Twas foolish, nervous, as she must allow,\nA fond hallucination, and a theme\n  For laughter—but she felt her spirits low,\nAnd begg'd they would excuse her; she 'd get over\nThis weakness in a few hours, and recover.\n\nAnd here Juanna kindly interposed,\n  And said she felt herself extremely well\nWhere she then was, as her sound sleep disclosed\n  When all around rang like a tocsin bell:\nShe did not find herself the least disposed\n  To quit her gentle partner, and to dwell\nApart from one who had no sin to show,\nSave that of dreaming once 'mal-a-propos.'\n\nAs thus Juanna spoke, Dudu turn'd round\n  And hid her face within Juanna's breast:\nHer neck alone was seen, but that was found\n  The colour of a budding rose's crest.\nI can't tell why she blush'd, nor can expound\n  The mystery of this rupture of their rest;\nAll that I know is, that the facts I state\nAre true as truth has ever been of late.\n\nAnd so good night to them,—or, if you will,\n  Good morrow—for the cock had crown, and light\nBegan to clothe each Asiatic hill,\n  And the mosque crescent struggled into sight\nOf the long caravan, which in the chill\n  Of dewy dawn wound slowly round each height\nThat stretches to the stony belt, which girds\nAsia, where Kaff looks down upon the Kurds.\n\nWith the first ray, or rather grey of morn,\n  Gulbeyaz rose from restlessness; and pale\nAs passion rises, with its bosom worn,\n  Array'd herself with mantle, gem, and veil.\nThe nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,\n  Which fable places in her breast of wail,\nIs lighter far of heart and voice than those\nWhose headlong passions form their proper woes.\n\nAnd that 's the moral of this composition,\n  If people would but see its real drift;—\nBut that they will not do without suspicion,\n  Because all gentle readers have the gift\nOf closing 'gainst the light their orbs of vision;\n  While gentle writers also love to lift\nTheir voices 'gainst each other, which is natural,\nThe numbers are too great for them to flatter all.\n\nRose the sultana from a bed of splendour,\n  Softer than the soft Sybarite's, who cried\nAloud because his feelings were too tender\n  To brook a ruffled rose-leaf by his side,—\nSo beautiful that art could little mend her,\n  Though pale with conflicts between love and pride;—\nSo agitated was she with her error,\nShe did not even look into the mirror.\n\nAlso arose about the self-same time,\n  Perhaps a little later, her great lord,\nMaster of thirty kingdoms so sublime,\n  And of a wife by whom he was abhorr'd;\nA thing of much less import in that clime—\n  At least to those of incomes which afford\nThe filling up their whole connubial cargo—\nThan where two wives are under an embargo.\n\nHe did not think much on the matter, nor\n  Indeed on any other: as a man\nHe liked to have a handsome paramour\n  At hand, as one may like to have a fan,\nAnd therefore of Circassians had good store,\n  As an amusement after the Divan;\nThough an unusual fit of love, or duty,\nHad made him lately bask in his bride's beauty.\n\nAnd now he rose; and after due ablutions\n  Exacted by the customs of the East,\nAnd prayers and other pious evolutions,\n  He drank six cups of coffee at the least,\nAnd then withdrew to hear about the Russians,\n  Whose victories had recently increased\nIn Catherine's reign, whom glory still adores,\n\nBut oh, thou grand legitimate Alexander!\n  Her son's son, let not this last phrase offend\nThine ear, if it should reach—and now rhymes wander\n  Almost as far as Petersburgh and lend\nA dreadful impulse to each loud meander\n  Of murmuring Liberty's wide waves, which blend\nTheir roar even with the Baltic's—so you be\nYour father's son, 'tis quite enough for me.\n\nTo call men love-begotten or proclaim\n  Their mothers as the antipodes of Timon,\nThat hater of mankind, would be a shame,\n  A libel, or whate'er you please to rhyme on:\nBut people's ancestors are history's game;\n  And if one lady's slip could leave a crime on\nAll generations, I should like to know\nWhat pedigree the best would have to show?\n\nHad Catherine and the sultan understood\n  Their own true interests, which kings rarely know\nUntil 'tis taught by lessons rather rude,\n  There was a way to end their strife, although\nPerhaps precarious, had they but thought good,\n  Without the aid of prince or plenipo:\nShe to dismiss her guards and he his haram,\nAnd for their other matters, meet and share 'em.\n\nBut as it was, his Highness had to hold\n  His daily council upon ways and means\nHow to encounter with this martial scold,\n  This modern Amazon and queen of queans;\nAnd the perplexity could not be told\n  Of all the pillars of the state, which leans\nSometimes a little heavy on the backs\nOf those who cannot lay on a new tax.\n\nMeantime Gulbeyaz, when her king was gone,\n  Retired into her boudoir, a sweet place\nFor love or breakfast; private, pleasing, lone,\n  And rich with all contrivances which grace\nThose gay recesses:—many a precious stone\n  Sparkled along its roof, and many a vase\nOf porcelain held in the fetter'd flowers,\nThose captive soothers of a captive's hours.\n\nMother of pearl, and porphyry, and marble,\n  Vied with each other on this costly spot;\nAnd singing birds without were heard to warble;\n  And the stain'd glass which lighted this fair grot\nVaried each ray;—but all descriptions garble\n  The true effect, and so we had better not\nBe too minute; an outline is the best,—\nA lively reader's fancy does the rest.\n\nAnd here she summon'd Baba, and required\n  Don Juan at his hands, and information\nOf what had pass'd since all the slaves retired,\n  And whether he had occupied their station;\nIf matters had been managed as desired,\n  And his disguise with due consideration\nKept up; and above all, the where and how\nHe had pass'd the night, was what she wish'd to know.\n\nBaba, with some embarrassment, replied\n  To this long catechism of questions, ask'd\nMore easily than answer'd,—that he had tried\n  His best to obey in what he had been task'd;\nBut there seem'd something that he wish'd to hide,\n  Which hesitation more betray'd than mask'd;\nHe scratch'd his ear, the infallible resource\nTo which embarrass'd people have recourse.\n\nGulbeyaz was no model of true patience,\n  Nor much disposed to wait in word or deed;\nShe liked quick answers in all conversations;\n  And when she saw him stumbling like a steed\nIn his replies, she puzzled him for fresh ones;\n  And as his speech grew still more broken-kneed,\nHer cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,\nAnd her proud brow's blue veins to swell and darkle.\n\nWhen Baba saw these symptoms, which he knew\n  To bode him no great good, he deprecated\nHer anger, and beseech'd she 'd hear him through—\n  He could not help the thing which he related:\nThen out it came at length, that to Dudu\n  Juan was given in charge, as hath been stated;\nBut not by Baba's fault, he said, and swore on\nThe holy camel's hump, besides the Koran.\n\nThe chief dame of the Oda, upon whom\n  The discipline of the whole haram bore,\nAs soon as they re-enter'd their own room,\n  For Baba's function stopt short at the door,\nHad settled all; nor could he then presume\n  (The aforesaid Baba) just then to do more,\nWithout exciting such suspicion as\nMight make the matter still worse than it was.\n\nHe hoped, indeed he thought, he could be sure\n  Juan had not betray'd himself; in fact\n'Twas certain that his conduct had been pure,\n  Because a foolish or imprudent act\nWould not alone have made him insecure,\n  But ended in his being found out and sack'd,\nAnd thrown into the sea.—Thus Baba spoke\nOf all save Dudu's dream, which was no joke.\n\nThis he discreetly kept in the background,\n  And talk'd away—and might have talk'd till now,\nFor any further answer that he found,\n  So deep an anguish wrung Gulbeyaz' brow:\nHer cheek turn'd ashes, ears rung, brain whirl'd round,\n  As if she had received a sudden blow,\nAnd the heart's dew of pain sprang fast and chilly\nO'er her fair front, like Morning's on a lily.\n\nAlthough she was not of the fainting sort,\n  Baba thought she would faint, but there he err'd—\nIt was but a convulsion, which though short\n  Can never be described; we all have heard,\nAnd some of us have felt thus 'all amort,'\n  When things beyond the common have occurr'd;—\nGulbeyaz proved in that brief agony\nWhat she could ne'er express—then how should I?\n\nShe stood a moment as a Pythones\n  Stands on her tripod, agonised, and full\nOf inspiration gather'd from distress,\n  When all the heart-strings like wild horses pull\nThe heart asunder;—then, as more or lees\n  Their speed abated or their strength grew dull,\nShe sunk down on her seat by slow degrees,\nAnd bow'd her throbbing head o'er trembling knees.\n\nHer face declined and was unseen; her hair\n  Fell in long tresses like the weeping willow,\nSweeping the marble underneath her chair,\n  Or rather sofa (for it was all pillow,\nA low soft ottoman), and black despair\n  Stirr'd up and down her bosom like a billow,\nWhich rushes to some shore whose shingles check\nIts farther course, but must receive its wreck.\n\nHer head hung down, and her long hair in stooping\n  Conceal'd her features better than a veil;\nAnd one hand o'er the ottoman lay drooping,\n  White, waxen, and as alabaster pale:\nWould that I were a painter! to be grouping\n  All that a poet drags into detail\nO that my words were colours! but their tints\nMay serve perhaps as outlines or slight hints.\n\nBaba, who knew by experience when to talk\n  And when to hold his tongue, now held it till\nThis passion might blow o'er, nor dared to balk\n  Gulbeyaz' taciturn or speaking will.\nAt length she rose up, and began to walk\n  Slowly along the room, but silent still,\nAnd her brow clear'd, but not her troubled eye;\nThe wind was down, but still the sea ran high.\n\nShe stopp'd, and raised her head to speak—but paused,\n  And then moved on again with rapid pace;\nThen slacken'd it, which is the march most caused\n  By deep emotion:—you may sometimes trace\nA feeling in each footstep, as disclosed\n  By Sallust in his Catiline, who, chased\nBy all the demons of all passions, show'd\nTheir work even by the way in which he trode.\n\nGulbeyaz stopp'd and beckon'd Baba:—'Slave!\n  Bring the two slaves!' she said in a low tone,\nBut one which Baba did not like to brave,\n  And yet he shudder'd, and seem'd rather prone\nTo prove reluctant, and begg'd leave to crave\n  (Though he well knew the meaning) to be shown\nWhat slaves her highness wish'd to indicate,\nFor fear of any error, like the late.\n\n'The Georgian and her paramour,' replied\n  The imperial bride—and added, 'Let the boat\nBe ready by the secret portal's side:\n  You know the rest.' The words stuck in her throat,\nDespite her injured love and fiery pride;\n  And of this Baba willingly took note,\nAnd begg'd by every hair of Mahomet's beard,\nShe would revoke the order he had heard.\n\n'To hear is to obey,' he said; 'but still,\n  Sultana, think upon the consequence:\nIt is not that I shall not all fulfil\n  Your orders, even in their severest sense;\nBut such precipitation may end ill,\n  Even at your own imperative expense:\nI do not mean destruction and exposure,\nIn case of any premature disclosure;\n\n'But your own feelings. Even should all the rest\n  Be hidden by the rolling waves, which hide\nAlready many a once love-beaten breast\n  Deep in the caverns of the deadly tide—\nYou love this boyish, new, seraglio guest,\n  And if this violent remedy be tried—\nExcuse my freedom, when I here assure you,\nThat killing him is not the way to cure you.'\n\n'What dost thou know of love or feeling?—Wretch!\n  Begone!' she cried, with kindling eyes—'and do\nMy bidding!' Baba vanish'd, for to stretch\n  His own remonstrance further he well knew\nMight end in acting as his own 'Jack Ketch;'\n  And though he wish'd extremely to get through\nThis awkward business without harm to others,\nHe still preferr'd his own neck to another's.\n\nAway he went then upon his commission,\n  Growling and grumbling in good Turkish phrase\nAgainst all women of whate'er condition,\n  Especially sultanas and their ways;\nTheir obstinacy, pride, and indecision,\n  Their never knowing their own mind two days,\nThe trouble that they gave, their immorality,\nWhich made him daily bless his own neutrality.\n\nAnd then he call'd his brethren to his aid,\n  And sent one on a summons to the pair,\nThat they must instantly be well array'd,\n  And above all be comb'd even to a hair,\nAnd brought before the empress, who had made\n  Inquiries after them with kindest care:\nAt which Dudu look'd strange, and Juan silly;\nBut go they must at once, and will I—nill I.\n\nAnd here I leave them at their preparation\n  For the imperial presence, wherein whether\nGulbeyaz show'd them both commiseration,\n  Or got rid of the parties altogether,\nLike other angry ladies of her nation,—\n  Are things the turning of a hair or feather\nMay settle; but far be 't from me to anticipate\nIn what way feminine caprice may dissipate.\n\nI leave them for the present with good wishes,\n  Though doubts of their well doing, to arrange\nAnother part of history; for the dishes\n  Of this our banquet we must sometimes change;\nAnd trusting Juan may escape the fishes,\n  Although his situation now seems strange\nAnd scarce secure, as such digressions are fair,\nThe Muse will take a little touch at warfare.</code>"

O Glory! what are ye who fly\n  Around us ever, rarely to alight?\nThere 's not a meteor in the polar sky\n  Of such transcendent and more fleeting flight.\nChill, and chain'd to cold earth, we lift on high\n  Our eyes in search of either lovely light;\nA thousand and a thousand colours they\nAssume, then leave us on our freezing way.\n\nAnd such as they are, such my present tale is,\n  A non-descript and ever-varying rhyme,\nA versified Aurora Borealis,\n  Which flashes o'er a waste and icy clime.\nWhen we know what all are, we must bewail us,\n  But ne'ertheless I hope it is no crime\nTo laugh at all things—for I wish to know\nWhat, after all, are all things—but a show?\n\nThey accuse me—Me—the present writer of\n  The present poem—of—I know not what—\nA tendency to under-rate and scoff\n  At human power and virtue, and all that;\nAnd this they say in language rather rough.\n  Good God! I wonder what they would be at!\nI say no more than hath been said in Dante's\nVerse, and by Solomon and by Cervantes;\n\nBy Swift, by Machiavel, by Rochefoucault,\n  By Fenelon, by Luther, and by Plato;\nBy Tillotson, and Wesley, and Rousseau,\n  Who knew this life was not worth a potato.\n'T is not their fault, nor mine, if this be so—\n  For my part, I pretend not to be Cato,\nNor even Diogenes.—We live and die,\nBut which is best, you know no more than I.\n\nSocrates said, our only knowledge was\n  'To know that nothing could be known;' a pleasant\nScience enough, which levels to an ass\n  Each man of wisdom, future, past, or present.\nNewton (that proverb of the mind), alas!\n  Declared, with all his grand discoveries recent,\nThat he himself felt only 'like a youth\nPicking up shells by the great ocean—Truth.'\n\nEcclesiastes said, 'that all is vanity'-\n  Most modern preachers say the same, or show it\nBy their examples of true Christianity:\n  In short, all know, or very soon may know it;\nAnd in this scene of all-confess'd inanity,\n  By saint, by sage, by preacher, and by poet,\nMust I restrain me, through the fear of strife,\nFrom holding up the nothingness of life?\n\nDogs, or men!—for I flatter you in saying\n  That ye are dogs—your betters far—ye may\nRead, or read not, what I am now essaying\n  To show ye what ye are in every way.\nAs little as the moon stops for the baying\n  Of wolves, will the bright muse withdraw one ray\nFrom out her skies—then howl your idle wrath!\nWhile she still silvers o'er your gloomy path.\n\n'Fierce loves and faithless wars'—I am not sure\n  If this be the right reading—'t is no matter;\nThe fact 's about the same, I am secure;\n  I sing them both, and am about to batter\nA town which did a famous siege endure,\n  And was beleaguer'd both by land and water\nBy Souvaroff, or Anglice Suwarrow,\nWho loved blood as an alderman loves marrow.\n\nThe fortress is call'd Ismail, and is placed\n  Upon the Danube's left branch and left bank,\nWith buildings in the Oriental taste,\n  But still a fortress of the foremost rank,\nOr was at least, unless 't is since defaced,\n  Which with your conquerors is a common prank:\nIt stands some eighty versts from the high sea,\nAnd measures round of toises thousands three.\n\nWithin the extent of this fortification\n  A borough is comprised along the height\nUpon the left, which from its loftier station\n  Commands the city, and upon its site\nA Greek had raised around this elevation\n  A quantity of palisades upright,\nSo placed as to impede the fire of those\nWho held the place, and to assist the foe's.\n\nThis circumstance may serve to give a notion\n  Of the high talents of this new Vauban:\nBut the town ditch below was deep as ocean,\n  The rampart higher than you 'd wish to hang:\nBut then there was a great want of precaution\n  (Prithee, excuse this engineering slang),\nNor work advanced, nor cover'd way was there,\nTo hint at least 'Here is no thoroughfare.'\n\nBut a stone bastion, with a narrow gorge,\n  And walls as thick as most skulls born as yet;\nTwo batteries, cap-a-pie, as our St. George,\n  Case-mated one, and t' other 'a barbette,'\nOf Danube's bank took formidable charge;\n  While two and twenty cannon duly set\nRose over the town's right side, in bristling tier,\nForty feet high, upon a cavalier.\n\nBut from the river the town 's open quite,\n  Because the Turks could never be persuaded\nA Russian vessel e'er would heave in sight;\n  And such their creed was, till they were invaded,\nWhen it grew rather late to set things right.\n  But as the Danube could not well be waded,\nThey look'd upon the Muscovite flotilla,\nAnd only shouted, 'Allah!' and 'Bis Millah!'\n\nThe Russians now were ready to attack:\n  But oh, ye goddesses of war and glory!\nHow shall I spell the name of each Cossacque\n  Who were immortal, could one tell their story?\nAlas! what to their memory can lack?\n  Achilles' self was not more grim and gory\nThan thousands of this new and polish'd nation,\nWhose names want nothing but—pronunciation.\n\nStill I 'll record a few, if but to increase\n  Our euphony: there was Strongenoff, and Strokonoff,\nMeknop, Serge Lwow, Arsniew of modern Greece,\n  And Tschitsshakoff, and Roguenoff, and Chokenoff,\nAnd others of twelve consonants apiece;\n  And more might be found out, if I could poke enough\nInto gazettes; but Fame (capricious strumpet),\nIt seems, has got an ear as well as trumpet,\n\nAnd cannot tune those discords of narration,\n  Which may be names at Moscow, into rhyme;\nYet there were several worth commemoration,\n  As e'er was virgin of a nuptial chime;\nSoft words, too, fitted for the peroration\n  Of Londonderry drawling against time,\nEnding in 'ischskin,' 'ousckin,' 'iffskchy,' 'ouski:\nOf whom we can insert but Rousamouski,\n\nScherematoff and Chrematoff, Koklophti,\n  Koclobski, Kourakin, and Mouskin Pouskin,\nAll proper men of weapons, as e'er scoff'd high\n  Against a foe, or ran a sabre through skin:\nLittle cared they for Mahomet or Mufti,\n  Unless to make their kettle-drums a new skin\nOut of their hides, if parchment had grown dear,\nAnd no more handy substitute been near.\n\nThen there were foreigners of much renown,\n  Of various nations, and all volunteers;\nNot fighting for their country or its crown,\n  But wishing to be one day brigadiers;\nAlso to have the sacking of a town,—\n  A pleasant thing to young men at their years.\n'Mongst them were several Englishmen of pith,\nSixteen call'd Thomson, and nineteen named Smith.\n\nJack Thomson and Bill Thomson; all the rest\n  Had been call'd 'Jemmy,' after the great bard;\nI don't know whether they had arms or crest,\n  But such a godfather 's as good a card.\nThree of the Smiths were Peters; but the best\n  Amongst them all, hard blows to inflict or ward,\nWas he, since so renown'd 'in country quarters\nAt Halifax;' but now he served the Tartars.\n\nThe rest were jacks and Gills and Wills and Bills;\n  But when I 've added that the elder jack Smith\nWas born in Cumberland among the hills,\n  And that his father was an honest blacksmith,\nI 've said all I know of a name that fills\n  Three lines of the despatch in taking 'Schmacksmith,'\nA village of Moldavia's waste, wherein\nHe fell, immortal in a bulletin.\n\nI wonder (although Mars no doubt 's a god\n  Praise) if a man's name in a bulletin\nMay make up for a bullet in his body?\n  I hope this little question is no sin,\nBecause, though I am but a simple noddy,\n  I think one Shakspeare puts the same thought in\nThe mouth of some one in his plays so doting,\nWhich many people pass for wits by quoting.\n\nThen there were Frenchmen, gallant, young, and gay:\n  But I 'm too great a patriot to record\nTheir Gallic names upon a glorious day;\n  I 'd rather tell ten lies than say a word\nOf truth;—such truths are treason; they betray\n  Their country; and as traitors are abhorr'd\nWho name the French in English, save to show\nHow Peace should make John Bull the Frenchman's foe.\n\nThe Russians, having built two batteries on\n  An isle near Ismail, had two ends in view;\nThe first was to bombard it, and knock down\n  The public buildings and the private too,\nNo matter what poor souls might be undone.\n  The city's shape suggested this, 't is true;\nForm'd like an amphitheatre, each dwelling\nPresented a fine mark to throw a shell in.\n\nThe second object was to profit by\n  The moment of the general consternation,\nTo attack the Turk's flotilla, which lay nigh\n  Extremely tranquil, anchor'd at its station:\nBut a third motive was as probably\n  To frighten them into capitulation;\nA phantasy which sometimes seizes warriors,\nUnless they are game as bull-dogs and fox-terriers.\n\nA habit rather blamable, which is\n  That of despising those we combat with,\nCommon in many cases, was in this\n  The cause of killing Tchitchitzkoff and Smith;\nOne of the valorous 'Smiths' whom we shall miss\n  Out of those nineteen who late rhymed to 'pith;'\nBut 't is a name so spread o'er 'Sir' and 'Madam,'\nThat one would think the first who bore it 'Adam.'\n\nThe Russian batteries were incomplete,\n  Because they were constructed in a hurry;\nThus the same cause which makes a verse want feet,\n  And throws a cloud o'er Longman and John Murray,\nWhen the sale of new books is not so fleet\n  As they who print them think is necessary,\nMay likewise put off for a time what story\nSometimes calls 'murder,' and at others 'glory.'\n\nWhether it was their engineer's stupidity,\n  Their haste, or waste, I neither know nor care,\nOr some contractor's personal cupidity,\n  Saving his soul by cheating in the ware\nOf homicide, but there was no solidity\n  In the new batteries erected there;\nThey either miss'd, or they were never miss'd,\nAnd added greatly to the missing list.\n\nA sad miscalculation about distance\n  Made all their naval matters incorrect;\nThree fireships lost their amiable existence\n  Before they reach'd a spot to take effect:\nThe match was lit too soon, and no assistance\n  Could remedy this lubberly defect;\nThey blew up in the middle of the river,\nWhile, though 't was dawn, the Turks slept fast as ever.\n\nAt seven they rose, however, and survey'd\n  The Russ flotilla getting under way;\n'T was nine, when still advancing undismay'd,\n  Within a cable's length their vessels lay\nOff Ismail, and commenced a cannonade,\n  Which was return'd with interest, I may say,\nAnd by a fire of musketry and grape,\nAnd shells and shot of every size and shape.\n\nFor six hours bore they without intermission\n  The Turkish fire, and aided by their own\nLand batteries, work'd their guns with great precision:\n  At length they found mere cannonade alone\nBy no means would produce the town's submission,\n  And made a signal to retreat at one.\nOne bark blew up, a second near the works\nRunning aground, was taken by the Turks.\n\nThe Moslem, too, had lost both ships and men;\n  But when they saw the enemy retire,\nTheir Delhis mann'd some boats, and sail'd again,\n  And gall'd the Russians with a heavy fire,\nAnd tried to make a landing on the main;\n  But here the effect fell short of their desire:\nCount Damas drove them back into the water\nPell-mell, and with a whole gazette of slaughter.\n\n'If' (says the historian here) 'I could report\n  All that the Russians did upon this day,\nI think that several volumes would fall short,\n  And I should still have many things to say;'\nAnd so he says no more—but pays his court\n  To some distinguish'd strangers in that fray;\nThe Prince de Ligne, and Langeron, and Damas,\nNames great as any that the roll of Fame has.\n\nThis being the case, may show us what Fame is:\n  For out of these three 'preux Chevaliers,' how\nMany of common readers give a guess\n  That such existed? (and they may live now\nFor aught we know.) Renown 's all hit or miss;\n  There 's fortune even in fame, we must allow.\n'T is true the Memoirs of the Prince de Ligne\nHave half withdrawn from him oblivion's screen.\n\nBut here are men who fought in gallant actions\n  As gallantly as ever heroes fought,\nBut buried in the heap of such transactions\n  Their names are rarely found, nor often sought.\nThus even good fame may suffer sad contractions,\n  And is extinguish'd sooner than she ought:\nOf all our modern battles, I will bet\nYou can't repeat nine names from each Gazette.\n\nIn short, this last attack, though rich in glory,\n  Show'd that somewhere, somehow, there was a fault,\nAnd Admiral Ribas (known in Russian story)\n  Most strongly recommended an assault;\nIn which he was opposed by young and hoary,\n  Which made a long debate; but I must halt,\nFor if I wrote down every warrior's speech,\nI doubt few readers e'er would mount the breach.\n\nThere was a man, if that he was a man,\n  Not that his manhood could be call'd in question,\nFor had he not been Hercules, his span\n  Had been as short in youth as indigestion\nMade his last illness, when, all worn and wan,\n  He died beneath a tree, as much unblest on\nThe soil of the green province he had wasted,\nAs e'er was locust on the land it blasted.\n\nThis was Potemkin—a great thing in days\n  When homicide and harlotry made great;\nIf stars and titles could entail long praise,\n  His glory might half equal his estate.\nThis fellow, being six foot high, could raise\n  A kind of phantasy proportionate\nIn the then sovereign of the Russian people,\nWho measured men as you would do a steeple.\n\nWhile things were in abeyance, Ribas sent\n  A courier to the prince, and he succeeded\nIn ordering matters after his own bent;\n  I cannot tell the way in which he pleaded,\nBut shortly he had cause to be content.\n  In the mean time, the batteries proceeded,\nAnd fourscore cannon on the Danube's border\nWere briskly fired and answer'd in due order.\n\nBut on the thirteenth, when already part\n  Of the troops were embark'd, the siege to raise,\nA courier on the spur inspired new heart\n  Into all panters for newspaper praise,\nAs well as dilettanti in war's art,\n  By his despatches couch'd in pithy phrase;\nAnnouncing the appointment of that lover of\nBattles to the command, Field-Marshal Souvaroff.\n\nThe letter of the prince to the same marshal\n  Was worthy of a Spartan, had the cause\nBeen one to which a good heart could be partial—\n  Defence of freedom, country, or of laws;\nBut as it was mere lust of power to o'er-arch all\n  With its proud brow, it merits slight applause,\nSave for its style, which said, all in a trice,\n'You will take Ismail at whatever price.'\n\n'Let there be light! said God, and there was light!'\n  'Let there be blood!' says man, and there 's a seal\nThe fiat of this spoil'd child of the Night\n  (For Day ne'er saw his merits) could decree\nMore evil in an hour, than thirty bright\n  Summers could renovate, though they should be\nLovely as those which ripen'd Eden's fruit;\nFor war cuts up not only branch, but root.\n\nOur friends the Turks, who with loud 'Allahs' now\n  Began to signalise the Russ retreat,\nWere damnably mistaken; few are slow\n  In thinking that their enemy is beat\n(Or beaten, if you insist on grammar, though\n  I never think about it in a heat),\nBut here I say the Turks were much mistaken,\nWho hating hogs, yet wish'd to save their bacon.\n\nFor, on the sixteenth, at full gallop, drew\n  In sight two horsemen, who were deem'd Cossacques\nFor some time, till they came in nearer view.\n  They had but little baggage at their backs,\nFor there were but three shirts between the two;\n  But on they rode upon two Ukraine hacks,\nTill, in approaching, were at length descried\nIn this plain pair, Suwarrow and his guide.\n\n'Great joy to London now!' says some great fool,\n  When London had a grand illumination,\nWhich to that bottle-conjurer, John Bull,\n  Is of all dreams the first hallucination;\nSo that the streets of colour'd lamps are full,\n  That Sage (said john) surrenders at discretion\nHis purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,\nTo gratify, like a huge moth, this one sense.\n\n'T is strange that he should farther 'damn his eyes,'\n  For they are damn'd; that once all-famous oath\nIs to the devil now no farther prize,\n  Since John has lately lost the use of both.\nDebt he calls wealth, and taxes Paradise;\n  And Famine, with her gaunt and bony growth,\nWhich stare him in the face, he won't examine,\nOr swears that Ceres hath begotten Famine.\n\nBut to the tale:—great joy unto the camp!\n  To Russian, Tartar, English, French, Cossacque,\nO'er whom Suwarrow shone like a gas lamp,\n  Presaging a most luminous attack;\nOr like a wisp along the marsh so damp,\n  Which leads beholders on a boggy walk,\nHe flitted to and fro a dancing light,\nWhich all who saw it follow'd, wrong or right.\n\nBut certes matters took a different face;\n  There was enthusiasm and much applause,\nThe fleet and camp saluted with great grace,\n  And all presaged good fortune to their cause.\nWithin a cannon-shot length of the place\n  They drew, constructed ladders, repair'd flaws\nIn former works, made new, prepared fascines,\nAnd all kinds of benevolent machines.\n\n'T is thus the spirit of a single mind\n  Makes that of multitudes take one direction,\nAs roll the waters to the breathing wind,\n  Or roams the herd beneath the bull's protection;\nOr as a little dog will lead the blind,\n  Or a bell-wether form the flock's connection\nBy tinkling sounds, when they go forth to victual;\nSuch is the sway of your great men o'er little.\n\nThe whole camp rung with joy; you would have thought\n  That they were going to a marriage feast\n(This metaphor, I think, holds good as aught,\n  Since there is discord after both at least):\nThere was not now a luggage boy but sought\n  Danger and spoil with ardour much increased;\nAnd why? because a little—odd—old man,\nStript to his shirt, was come to lead the van.\n\nBut so it was; and every preparation\n  Was made with all alacrity: the first\nDetachment of three columns took its station,\n  And waited but the signal's voice to burst\nUpon the foe: the second's ordination\n  Was also in three columns, with a thirst\nFor glory gaping o'er a sea of slaughter:\nThe third, in columns two, attack'd by water.\n\nNew batteries were erected, and was held\n  A general council, in which unanimity,\nThat stranger to most councils, here prevail'd,\n  As sometimes happens in a great extremity;\nAnd every difficulty being dispell'd,\n  Glory began to dawn with due sublimity,\nWhile Souvaroff, determined to obtain it,\nWas teaching his recruits to use the bayonet\n\nIt is an actual fact, that he, commander\n  In chief, in proper person deign'd to drill\nThe awkward squad, and could afford to squander\n  His time, a corporal's duty to fulfil:\nJust as you 'd break a sucking salamander\n  To swallow flame, and never take it ill:\nHe show'd them how to mount a ladder (which\nWas not like Jacob's) or to cross a ditch.\n\nAlso he dress'd up, for the nonce, fascines\n  Like men with turbans, scimitars, and dirks,\nAnd made them charge with bayonet these machines,\n  By way of lesson against actual Turks:\nAnd when well practised in these mimic scenes,\n  He judged them proper to assail the works;\nAt which your wise men sneer'd in phrases witty:\nHe made no answer; but he took the city.\n\nMost things were in this posture on the eve\n  Of the assault, and all the camp was in\nA stern repose; which you would scarce conceive;\n  Yet men resolved to dash through thick and thin\nAre very silent when they once believe\n  That all is settled:—there was little din,\nFor some were thinking of their home and friends,\nAnd others of themselves and latter ends.\n\nSuwarrow chiefly was on the alert,\n  Surveying, drilling, ordering, jesting, pondering;\nFor the man was, we safely may assert,\n  A thing to wonder at beyond most wondering;\nHero, buffoon, half-demon, and half-dirt,\n  Praying, instructing, desolating, plundering;\nNow Mars, now Momus; and when bent to storm\nA fortress, Harlequin in uniform.\n\nThe day before the assault, while upon drill—\n  For this great conqueror play'd the corporal—\nSome Cossacques, hovering like hawks round a hill,\n  Had met a party towards the twilight's fall,\nOne of whom spoke their tongue—or well or ill,\n  'T was much that he was understood at all;\nBut whether from his voice, or speech, or manner,\nThey found that he had fought beneath their banner.\n\nWhereon immediately at his request\n  They brought him and his comrades to head-quarters;\nTheir dress was Moslem, but you might have guess'd\n  That these were merely masquerading Tartars,\nAnd that beneath each Turkish-fashion'd vest\n  Lurk'd Christianity; which sometimes barters\nHer inward grace for outward show, and makes\nIt difficult to shun some strange mistakes.\n\nSuwarrow, who was standing in his shirt\n  Before a company of Calmucks, drilling,\nExclaiming, fooling, swearing at the inert,\n  And lecturing on the noble art of killing,—\nFor deeming human clay but common dirt,\n  This great philosopher was thus instilling\nHis maxims, which to martial comprehension\nProved death in battle equal to a pension;—\n\nSuwarrow, when he saw this company\n  Of Cossacques and their prey, turn'd round and cast\nUpon them his slow brow and piercing eye:—\n  'Whence come ye?'—'From Constantinople last,\nCaptives just now escaped,' was the reply.\n  'What are ye?'—'What you see us.' Briefly pass'd\nThis dialogue; for he who answer'd knew\nTo whom he spoke, and made his words but few.\n\n'Your names?'—'Mine 's Johnson, and my comrade 's Juan;\n  The other two are women, and the third\nIs neither man nor woman.' The chief threw on\n  The party a slight glance, then said, 'I have heard\nYour name before, the second is a new one:\n  To bring the other three here was absurd:\nBut let that pass:—I think I have heard your name\nIn the Nikolaiew regiment?'—'The same.'\n\n'You served at Widdin?'—'Yes.'—'You led the attack?'\n  'I did.'—'What next?'—'I really hardly know.'\n'You were the first i' the breach?'—'I was not slack\n  At least to follow those who might be so.'\n'What follow'd?'—'A shot laid me on my back,\n  And I became a prisoner to the foe.'\n'You shall have vengeance, for the town surrounded\nIs twice as strong as that where you were wounded.\n\n'Where will you serve?'—'Where'er you please.'—'I know\n  You like to be the hope of the forlorn,\nAnd doubtless would be foremost on the foe\n  After the hardships you 've already borne.\nAnd this young fellow—say what can he do?\n  He with the beardless chin and garments torn?'\n'Why, general, if he hath no greater fault\nIn war than love, he had better lead the assault.'\n\n'He shall if that he dare.' Here Juan bow'd\n  Low as the compliment deserved. Suwarrow\nContinued: 'Your old regiment's allow'd,\n  By special providence, to lead to-morrow,\nOr it may be to-night, the assault: I have vow'd\n  To several saints, that shortly plough or harrow\nShall pass o'er what was Ismail, and its tusk\nBe unimpeded by the proudest mosque.\n\n'So now, my lads, for glory!'—Here he turn'd\n  And drill'd away in the most classic Russian,\nUntil each high, heroic bosom burn'd\n  For cash and conquest, as if from a cushion\nA preacher had held forth (who nobly spurn'd\n  All earthly goods save tithes) and bade them push on\nTo slay the Pagans who resisted, battering\nThe armies of the Christian Empress Catherine.\n\nJohnson, who knew by this long colloquy\n  Himself a favourite, ventured to address\nSuwarrow, though engaged with accents high\n  In his resumed amusement. 'I confess\nMy debt in being thus allow'd to die\n  Among the foremost; but if you 'd express\nExplicitly our several posts, my friend\nAnd self would know what duty to attend.'\n\n'Right! I was busy, and forgot. Why, you\n  Will join your former regiment, which should be\nNow under arms. Ho! Katskoff, take him to\n  (Here he call'd up a Polish orderly)\nHis post, I mean the regiment Nikolaiew:\n  The stranger stripling may remain with me;\nHe 's a fine boy. The women may be sent\nTo the other baggage, or to the sick tent.'\n\nBut here a sort of scene began to ensue:\n  The ladies,—who by no means had been bred\nTo be disposed of in a way so new,\n  Although their haram education led\nDoubtless to that of doctrines the most true,\n  Passive obedience,—now raised up the head,\nWith flashing eyes and starting tears, and flung\nTheir arms, as hens their wings about their young,\n\nO'er the promoted couple of brave men\n  Who were thus honour'd by the greatest chief\nThat ever peopled hell with heroes slain,\n  Or plunged a province or a realm in grief.\nO, foolish mortals! Always taught in vain!\n  O, glorious laurel! since for one sole leaf\nOf thine imaginary deathless tree,\nOf blood and tears must flow the unebbing sea.\n\nSuwarrow, who had small regard for tears,\n  And not much sympathy for blood, survey'd\nThe women with their hair about their ears\n  And natural agonies, with a slight shade\nOf feeling: for however habit sears\n  Men's hearts against whole millions, when their trade\nIs butchery, sometimes a single sorrow\nWill touch even heroes—and such was Suwarrow.\n\nHe said,—and in the kindest Calmuck tone,—\n  'Why, Johnson, what the devil do you mean\nBy bringing women here? They shall be shown\n  All the attention possible, and seen\nIn safety to the waggons, where alone\n  In fact they can be safe. You should have been\nAware this kind of baggage never thrives:\nSave wed a year, I hate recruits with wives.'\n\n'May it please your excellency,' thus replied\n  Our British friend, 'these are the wives of others,\nAnd not our own. I am too qualified\n  By service with my military brothers\nTo break the rules by bringing one's own bride\n  Into a camp: I know that nought so bothers\nThe hearts of the heroic on a charge,\nAs leaving a small family at large.\n\n'But these are but two Turkish ladies, who\n  With their attendant aided our escape,\nAnd afterwards accompanied us through\n  A thousand perils in this dubious shape.\nTo me this kind of life is not so new;\n  To them, poor things, it is an awkward scrape.\nI therefore, if you wish me to fight freely,\nRequest that they may both be used genteelly.'\n\nMeantime these two poor girls, with swimming eyes,\n  Look'd on as if in doubt if they could trust\nTheir own protectors; nor was their surprise\n  Less than their grief (and truly not less just)\nTo see an old man, rather wild than wise\n  In aspect, plainly clad, besmear'd with dust,\nStript to his waistcoat, and that not too clean,\nMore fear'd than all the sultans ever seen.\n\nFor every thing seem'd resting on his nod,\n  As they could read in all eyes. Now to them,\nWho were accustom'd, as a sort of god,\n  To see the sultan, rich in many a gem,\nLike an imperial peacock stalk abroad\n  (That royal bird, whose tail 's a diadem),\nWith all the pomp of power, it was a doubt\nHow power could condescend to do without.\n\nJohn Johnson, seeing their extreme dismay,\n  Though little versed in feelings oriental,\nSuggested some slight comfort in his way:\n  Don Juan, who was much more sentimental,\nSwore they should see him by the dawn of day,\n  Or that the Russian army should repent all:\nAnd, strange to say, they found some consolation\nIn this—for females like exaggeration.\n\nAnd then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,\n  They parted for the present—these to await,\nAccording to the artillery's hits or misses,\n  What sages call Chance, Providence, or Fate\n(Uncertainty is one of many blisses,\n  A mortgage on Humanity's estate)—\nWhile their beloved friends began to arm,\nTo burn a town which never did them harm.\n\nSuwarrow,—who but saw things in the gross,\n  Being much too gross to see them in detail,\nWho calculated life as so much dross,\n  And as the wind a widow'd nation's wail,\nAnd cared as little for his army's loss\n  (So that their efforts should at length prevail)\nAs wife and friends did for the boils of job,—\nWhat was 't to him to hear two women sob?\n\nNothing.—The work of glory still went on\n  In preparations for a cannonade\nAs terrible as that of Ilion,\n  If Homer had found mortars ready made;\nBut now, instead of slaying Priam's son,\n  We only can but talk of escalade,\nBombs, drums, guns, bastions, batteries, bayonets, bullets,—\nHard words, which stick in the soft Muses' gullets.\n\nO, thou eternal Homer! who couldst charm\n  All cars, though long; all ages, though so short,\nBy merely wielding with poetic arm\n  Arms to which men will never more resort,\nUnless gunpowder should be found to harm\n  Much less than is the hope of every court,\nWhich now is leagued young Freedom to annoy;\nBut they will not find Liberty a Troy:—\n\nO, thou eternal Homer! I have now\n  To paint a siege, wherein more men were slain,\nWith deadlier engines and a speedier blow,\n  Than in thy Greek gazette of that campaign;\nAnd yet, like all men else, I must allow,\n  To vie with thee would be about as vain\nAs for a brook to cope with ocean's flood;\nBut still we moderns equal you in blood;\n\nIf not in poetry, at least in fact;\n  And fact is truth, the grand desideratum!\nOf which, howe'er the Muse describes each act,\n  There should be ne'ertheless a slight substratum.\nBut now the town is going to be attack'd;\n  Great deeds are doing—how shall I relate 'em?\nSouls of immortal generals! Phoebus watches\nTo colour up his rays from your despatches.\n\nO, ye great bulletins of Bonaparte!\n  O, ye less grand long lists of kill'd and wounded!\nShade of Leonidas, who fought so hearty,\n  When my poor Greece was once, as now, surrounded!\nO, Caesar's Commentaries! now impart, ye\n  Shadows of glory! (lest I be confounded)\nA portion of your fading twilight hues,\nSo beautiful, so fleeting, to the Muse.\n\nWhen I call 'fading' martial immortality,\n  I mean, that every age and every year,\nAnd almost every day, in sad reality,\n  Some sucking hero is compell'd to rear,\nWho, when we come to sum up the totality\n  Of deeds to human happiness most dear,\nTurns out to be a butcher in great business,\nAfflicting young folks with a sort of dizziness.\n\nMedals, rank, ribands, lace, embroidery, scarlet,\n  Are things immortal to immortal man,\nAs purple to the Babylonian harlot:\n  An uniform to boys is like a fan\nTo women; there is scarce a crimson varlet\n  But deems himself the first in Glory's van.\nBut Glory's glory; and if you would find\nWhat that is—ask the pig who sees the wind!\n\nAt least he feels it, and some say he sees,\n  Because he runs before it like a pig;\nOr, if that simple sentence should displease,\n  Say, that he scuds before it like a brig,\nA schooner, or—but it is time to ease\n  This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.\nThe next shall ring a peal to shake all people,\nLike a bob-major from a village steeple.\n\nHark! through the silence of the cold, dull night,\n  The hum of armies gathering rank on rank!\nLo! dusky masses steal in dubious sight\n  Along the leaguer'd wall and bristling bank\nOf the arm'd river, while with straggling light\n  The stars peep through the vapours dim and dank,\nWhich curl in curious wreaths:—how soon the smoke\nOf Hell shall pall them in a deeper cloak!\n\nHere pause we for the present—as even then\n  That awful pause, dividing life from death,\nStruck for an instant on the hearts of men,\n  Thousands of whom were drawing their last breath!\nA moment—and all will be life again!\n  The march! the charge! the shouts of either faith!\nHurra! and Allah! and—one moment more,\nThe death-cry drowning in the battle's roar.</code>"

Call them Mars,\nBellona, what you will—they mean but wars.\n\nAll was prepared—the fire, the sword, the men\n  To wield them in their terrible array.\nThe army, like a lion from his den,\n  March'd forth with nerve and sinews bent to slay,—\nA human Hydra, issuing from its fen\n  To breathe destruction on its winding way,\nWhose heads were heroes, which cut off in vain\nImmediately in others grew again.\n\nHistory can only take things in the gross;\n  But could we know them in detail, perchance\nIn balancing the profit and the loss,\n  War's merit it by no means might enhance,\nTo waste so much gold for a little dross,\n  As hath been done, mere conquest to advance.\nThe drying up a single tear has more\nOf honest fame, than shedding seas of gore.\n\nAnd why?—because it brings self-approbation;\n  Whereas the other, after all its glare,\nShouts, bridges, arches, pensions from a nation,\n  Which (it may be) has not much left to spare,\nA higher title, or a loftier station,\n  Though they may make Corruption gape or stare,\nYet, in the end, except in Freedom's battles,\nAre nothing but a child of Murder's rattles.\n\nAnd such they are—and such they will be found:\n  Not so Leonidas and Washington,\nWhose every battle-field is holy ground,\n  Which breathes of nations saved, not worlds undone.\nHow sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!\n  While the mere victor's may appal or stun\nThe servile and the vain, such names will be\nA watchword till the future shall be free.\n\nThe night was dark, and the thick mist allow'd\n  Nought to be seen save the artillery's flame,\nWhich arch'd the horizon like a fiery cloud,\n  And in the Danube's waters shone the same—\nA mirror'd hell! the volleying roar, and loud\n  Long booming of each peal on peal, o'ercame\nThe ear far more than thunder; for Heaven's flashes\nSpare, or smite rarely—man's make millions ashes!\n\nThe column order'd on the assault scarce pass'd\n  Beyond the Russian batteries a few toises,\nWhen up the bristling Moslem rose at last,\n  Answering the Christian thunders with like voices:\nThen one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,\n  Which rock'd as 't were beneath the mighty noises;\nWhile the whole rampart blazed like Etna, when\nThe restless Titan hiccups in his den.\n\nAnd one enormous shout of 'Allah!' rose\n  In the same moment, loud as even the roar\nOf war's most mortal engines, to their foes\n  Hurling defiance: city, stream, and shore\nResounded 'Allah!' and the clouds which close\n  With thick'ning canopy the conflict o'er,\nVibrate to the Eternal name. Hark! through\nAll sounds it pierceth 'Allah! Allah! Hu!'\n\nThe columns were in movement one and all,\n  But of the portion which attack'd by water,\nThicker than leaves the lives began to fall,\n  Though led by Arseniew, that great son of slaughter,\nAs brave as ever faced both bomb and ball.\n  'Carnage' (so Wordsworth tells you) 'is God's daughter:'\nIf he speak truth, she is Christ's sister, and\nJust now behaved as in the Holy Land.\n\nThe Prince de Ligne was wounded in the knee;\n  Count Chapeau-Bras, too, had a ball between\nHis cap and head, which proves the head to be\n  Aristocratic as was ever seen,\nBecause it then received no injury\n  More than the cap; in fact, the ball could mean\nNo harm unto a right legitimate head:\n'Ashes to ashes'—why not lead to lead?\n\nAlso the General Markow, Brigadier,\n  Insisting on removal of the prince\nAmidst some groaning thousands dying near,—\n  All common fellows, who might writhe and wince,\nAnd shriek for water into a deaf ear,—\n  The General Markow, who could thus evince\nHis sympathy for rank, by the same token,\nTo teach him greater, had his own leg broken.\n\nThree hundred cannon threw up their emetic,\n  And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills\nLike hail, to make a bloody diuretic.\n  Mortality! thou hast thy monthly bills;\nThy plagues, thy famines, thy physicians, yet tick,\n  Like the death-watch, within our ears the ills\nPast, present, and to come;—but all may yield\nTo the true portrait of one battle-field.\n\nThere the still varying pangs, which multiply\n  Until their very number makes men hard\nBy the infinities of agony,\n  Which meet the gaze whate'er it may regard—\nThe groan, the roll in dust, the all-white eye\n  Turn'd back within its socket,—these reward\nYour rank and file by thousands, while the rest\nMay win perhaps a riband at the breast!\n\nYet I love glory;—glory 's a great thing:—\n  Think what it is to be in your old age\nMaintain'd at the expense of your good king:\n  A moderate pension shakes full many a sage,\nAnd heroes are but made for bards to sing,\n  Which is still better; thus in verse to wage\nYour wars eternally, besides enjoying\nHalf-pay for life, make mankind worth destroying.\n\nThe troops, already disembark'd, push'd on\n  To take a battery on the right; the others,\nWho landed lower down, their landing done,\n  Had set to work as briskly as their brothers:\nBeing grenadiers, they mounted one by one,\n  Cheerful as children climb the breasts of mothers,\nO'er the entrenchment and the palisade,\nQuite orderly, as if upon parade.\n\nAnd this was admirable; for so hot\n  The fire was, that were red Vesuvius loaded,\nBesides its lava, with all sorts of shot\n  And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.\nOf officers a third fell on the spot,\n  A thing which victory by no means boded\nTo gentlemen engaged in the assault:\nHounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault.\n\nBut here I leave the general concern,\n  To track our hero on his path of fame:\nHe must his laurels separately earn;\n  For fifty thousand heroes, name by name,\nThough all deserving equally to turn\n  A couplet, or an elegy to claim,\nWould form a lengthy lexicon of glory,\nAnd what is worse still, a much longer story:\n\nAnd therefore we must give the greater number\n  To the Gazette—which doubtless fairly dealt\nBy the deceased, who lie in famous slumber\n  In ditches, fields, or wheresoe'er they felt\nTheir clay for the last time their souls encumber;—\n  Thrice happy he whose name has been well spelt\nIn the despatch: I knew a man whose loss\nWas printed Grove, although his name was Grose.\n\nJuan and Johnson join'd a certain corps,\n  And fought away with might and main, not knowing\nThe way which they had never trod before,\n  And still less guessing where they might be going;\nBut on they march'd, dead bodies trampling o'er,\n  Firing, and thrusting, slashing, sweating, glowing,\nBut fighting thoughtlessly enough to win,\nTo their two selves, one whole bright bulletin.\n\nThus on they wallow'd in the bloody mire\n  Of dead and dying thousands,—sometimes gaining\nA yard or two of ground, which brought them nigher\n  To some odd angle for which all were straining;\nAt other times, repulsed by the close fire,\n  Which really pour'd as if all hell were raining\nInstead of heaven, they stumbled backwards o'er\nA wounded comrade, sprawling in his gore.\n\nThough 't was Don Juan's first of fields, and though\n  The nightly muster and the silent march\nIn the chill dark, when courage does not glow\n  So much as under a triumphal arch,\nPerhaps might make him shiver, yawn, or throw\n  A glance on the dull clouds (as thick as starch,\nWhich stiffen'd heaven) as if he wish'd for day;—\nYet for all this he did not run away.\n\nIndeed he could not. But what if he had?\n  There have been and are heroes who begun\nWith something not much better, or as bad:\n  Frederic the Great from Molwitz deign'd to run,\nFor the first and last time; for, like a pad,\n  Or hawk, or bride, most mortals after one\nWarm bout are broken into their new tricks,\nAnd fight like fiends for pay or politics.\n\nHe was what Erin calls, in her sublime\n  Old Erse or Irish, or it may be Punic\n(The antiquarians who can settle time,\n  Which settles all things, Roman, Greek, or Runic,\nSwear that Pat's language sprung from the same clime\n  With Hannibal, and wears the Tyrian tunic\nOf Dido's alphabet; and this is rational\nAs any other notion, and not national);—\n\nBut Juan was quite 'a broth of a boy,'\n  A thing of impulse and a child of song;\nNow swimming in the sentiment of joy,\n  Or the sensation (if that phrase seem wrong),\nAnd afterward, if he must needs destroy,\n  In such good company as always throng\nTo battles, sieges, and that kind of pleasure,\nNo less delighted to employ his leisure;\n\nBut always without malice: if he warr'd\n  Or loved, it was with what we call 'the best\nIntentions,' which form all mankind's trump card,\n  To be produced when brought up to the test.\nThe statesman, hero, harlot, lawyer—ward\n  Off each attack, when people are in quest\nOf their designs, by saying they meant well;\n'T is pity 'that such meaning should pave hell.'\n\nI almost lately have begun to doubt\n  Whether hell's pavement—if it be so paved—\nMust not have latterly been quite worn out,\n  Not by the numbers good intent hath saved,\nBut by the mass who go below without\n  Those ancient good intentions, which once shaved\nAnd smooth'd the brimstone of that street of hell\nWhich bears the greatest likeness to Pall Mall.\n\nJuan, by some strange chance, which oft divides\n  Warrior from warrior in their grim career,\nLike chastest wives from constant husbands' sides\n  Just at the close of the first bridal year,\nBy one of those odd turns of Fortune's tides,\n  Was on a sudden rather puzzled here,\nWhen, after a good deal of heavy firing,\nHe found himself alone, and friends retiring.\n\nI don't know how the thing occurr'd—it might\n  Be that the greater part were kill'd or wounded,\nAnd that the rest had faced unto the right\n  About; a circumstance which has confounded\nCaesar himself, who, in the very sight\n  Of his whole army, which so much abounded\nIn courage, was obliged to snatch a shield,\nAnd rally back his Romans to the field.\n\nJuan, who had no shield to snatch, and was\n  No Caesar, but a fine young lad, who fought\nHe knew not why, arriving at this pass,\n  Stopp'd for a minute, as perhaps he ought\nFor a much longer time; then, like an as\n  (Start not, kind reader; since great Homer thought\nThis simile enough for Ajax, Juan\nPerhaps may find it better than a new one)—\n\nThen, like an ass, he went upon his way,\n  And, what was stranger, never look'd behind;\nBut seeing, flashing forward, like the day\n  Over the hills, a fire enough to blind\nThose who dislike to look upon a fray,\n  He stumbled on, to try if he could find\nA path, to add his own slight arm and forces\nTo corps, the greater part of which were corses.\n\nPerceiving then no more the commandant\n  Of his own corps, nor even the corps, which had\nQuite disappear'd—the gods know howl (I can't\n  Account for every thing which may look bad\nIn history; but we at least may grant\n  It was not marvellous that a mere lad,\nIn search of glory, should look on before,\nNor care a pinch of snuff about his corps):—\n\nPerceiving nor commander nor commanded,\n  And left at large, like a young heir, to make\nHis way to—where he knew not—single handed;\n  As travellers follow over bog and brake\nAn 'ignis fatuus;' or as sailors stranded\n  Unto the nearest hut themselves betake;\nSo Juan, following honour and his nose,\nRush'd where the thickest fire announced most foes.\n\nHe knew not where he was, nor greatly cared,\n  For he was dizzy, busy, and his veins\nFill'd as with lightning—for his spirit shared\n  The hour, as is the case with lively brains;\nAnd where the hottest fire was seen and heard,\n  And the loud cannon peal'd his hoarsest strains,\nHe rush'd, while earth and air were sadly shaken\nBy thy humane discovery, Friar Bacon!\n\nAnd as he rush'd along, it came to pass he\n  Fell in with what was late the second column,\nUnder the orders of the General Lascy,\n  But now reduced, as is a bulky volume\nInto an elegant extract (much less massy)\n  Of heroism, and took his place with solemn\nAir 'midst the rest, who kept their valiant faces\nAnd levell'd weapons still against the glacis.\n\nJust at this crisis up came Johnson too,\n  Who had 'retreated,' as the phrase is when\nMen run away much rather than go through\n  Destruction's jaws into the devil's den;\nBut Johnson was a clever fellow, who\n  Knew when and how 'to cut and come again,'\nAnd never ran away, except when running\nWas nothing but a valorous kind of cunning.\n\nAnd so, when all his corps were dead or dying,\n  Except Don Juan, a mere novice, whose\nMore virgin valour never dreamt of flying\n  From ignorance of danger, which indues\nIts votaries, like innocence relying\n  On its own strength, with careless nerves and thews,—\nJohnson retired a little, just to rally\nThose who catch cold in 'shadows of Death's valley.'\n\nAnd there, a little shelter'd from the shot,\n  Which rain'd from bastion, battery, parapet,\nRampart, wall, casement, house,—for there was not\n  In this extensive city, sore beset\nBy Christian soldiery, a single spot\n  Which did not combat like the devil, as yet,\nHe found a number of Chasseurs, all scatter'd\nBy the resistance of the chase they batter'd.\n\nAnd these he call'd on; and, what 's strange, they came\n  Unto his call, unlike 'the spirits from\nThe vasty deep,' to whom you may exclaim,\n  Says Hotspur, long ere they will leave their home.\nTheir reasons were uncertainty, or shame\n  At shrinking from a bullet or a bomb,\nAnd that odd impulse, which in wars or creeds\nMakes men, like cattle, follow him who leads.\n\nBy Jove! he was a noble fellow, Johnson,\n  And though his name, than Ajax or Achilles,\nSounds less harmonious, underneath the sun soon\n  We shall not see his likeness: he could kill his\nMan quite as quietly as blows the monsoon\n  Her steady breath (which some months the same still is):\nSeldom he varied feature, hue, or muscle,\nAnd could be very busy without bustle;\n\nAnd therefore, when he ran away, he did so\n  Upon reflection, knowing that behind\nHe would find others who would fain be rid so\n  Of idle apprehensions, which like wind\nTrouble heroic stomachs. Though their lids so\n  Oft are soon closed, all heroes are not blind,\nBut when they light upon immediate death,\nRetire a little, merely to take breath.\n\nBut Johnson only ran off, to return\n  With many other warriors, as we said,\nUnto that rather somewhat misty bourn,\n  Which Hamlet tells us is a pass of dread.\nTo Jack howe'er this gave but slight concern:\n  His soul (like galvanism upon the dead)\nActed upon the living as on wire,\nAnd led them back into the heaviest fire.\n\nEgad! they found the second time what they\n  The first time thought quite terrible enough\nTo fly from, malgre all which people say\n  Of glory, and all that immortal stuff\nWhich fills a regiment (besides their pay,\n  That daily shilling which makes warriors tough)—\nThey found on their return the self-same welcome,\nWhich made some think, and others know, a hell come.\n\nThey fell as thick as harvests beneath hail,\n  Grass before scythes, or corn below the sickle,\nProving that trite old truth, that life 's as frail\n  As any other boon for which men stickle.\nThe Turkish batteries thrash'd them like a flail,\n  Or a good boxer, into a sad pickle\nPutting the very bravest, who were knock'd\nUpon the head, before their guns were cock'd.\n\nThe Turks, behind the traverses and flanks\n  Of the next bastion, fired away like devils,\nAnd swept, as gales sweep foam away, whole ranks:\n  However, Heaven knows how, the Fate who levels\nTowns, nations, worlds, in her revolving pranks,\n  So order'd it, amidst these sulphury revels,\nThat Johnson and some few who had not scamper'd,\nReach'd the interior talus of the rampart.\n\nFirst one or two, then five, six, and a dozen,\n  Came mounting quickly up, for it was now\nAll neck or nothing, as, like pitch or rosin,\n  Flame was shower'd forth above, as well 's below,\nSo that you scarce could say who best had chosen,\n  The gentlemen that were the first to show\nTheir martial faces on the parapet,\nOr those who thought it brave to wait as yet.\n\nBut those who scaled, found out that their advance\n  Was favour'd by an accident or blunder:\nThe Greek or Turkish Cohorn's ignorance\n  Had palisado'd in a way you 'd wonder\nTo see in forts of Netherlands or France\n  (Though these to our Gibraltar must knock under)—\nRight in the middle of the parapet\nJust named, these palisades were primly set:\n\nSo that on either side some nine or ten\n  Paces were left, whereon you could contrive\nTo march; a great convenience to our men,\n  At least to all those who were left alive,\nWho thus could form a line and fight again;\n  And that which farther aided them to strive\nWas, that they could kick down the palisades,\nWhich scarcely rose much higher than grass blades.\n\nAmong the first,—I will not say the first,\n  For such precedence upon such occasions\nWill oftentimes make deadly quarrels burst\n  Out between friends as well as allied nations:\nThe Briton must be bold who really durst\n  Put to such trial John Bull's partial patience,\nAs say that Wellington at Waterloo\nWas beaten—though the Prussians say so too;—\n\nAnd that if Blucher, Bulow, Gneisenau,\n  And God knows who besides in 'au' and 'ow,'\nHad not come up in time to cast an awe\n  Into the hearts of those who fought till now\nAs tigers combat with an empty craw,\n  The Duke of Wellington had ceased to show\nHis orders, also to receive his pensions,\nWhich are the heaviest that our history mentions.\n\nBut never mind;—'God save the king!' and kings!\n  For if he don't, I doubt if men will longer—\nI think I hear a little bird, who sings\n  The people by and by will be the stronger:\nThe veriest jade will wince whose harness wrings\n  So much into the raw as quite to wrong her\nBeyond the rules of posting,—and the mob\nAt last fall sick of imitating Job.\n\nAt first it grumbles, then it swears, and then,\n  Like David, flings smooth pebbles 'gainst a giant;\nAt last it takes to weapons such as men\n  Snatch when despair makes human hearts less pliant.\nThen comes 'the tug of war;'—'t will come again,\n  I rather doubt; and I would fain say 'fie on 't,'\nIf I had not perceived that revolution\nAlone can save the earth from hell's pollution.\n\nBut to continue:—I say not the first,\n  But of the first, our little friend Don Juan\nWalk'd o'er the walls of Ismail, as if nursed\n  Amidst such scenes—though this was quite a new one\nTo him, and I should hope to most. The thirst\n  Of glory, which so pierces through and through one,\nPervaded him—although a generous creature,\nAs warm in heart as feminine in feature.\n\nAnd here he was—who upon woman's breast,\n  Even from a child, felt like a child; howe'er\nThe man in all the rest might be confest,\n  To him it was Elysium to be there;\nAnd he could even withstand that awkward test\n  Which Rousseau points out to the dubious fair,\n'Observe your lover when he leaves your arms;'\nBut Juan never left them, while they had charms,\n\nUnless compell'd by fate, or wave, or wind,\n  Or near relations, who are much the same.\nBut here he was!—where each tie that can bind\n  Humanity must yield to steel and flame:\nAnd he whose very body was all mind,\n  Flung here by fate or circumstance, which tame\nThe loftiest, hurried by the time and place,\nDash'd on like a spurr'd blood-horse in a race.\n\nSo was his blood stirr'd while he found resistance,\n  As is the hunter's at the five-bar gate,\nOr double post and rail, where the existence\n  Of Britain's youth depends upon their weight,\nThe lightest being the safest: at a distance\n  He hated cruelty, as all men hate\nBlood, until heated—and even then his own\nAt times would curdle o'er some heavy groan.\n\nThe General Lascy, who had been hard press'd,\n  Seeing arrive an aid so opportune\nAs were some hundred youngsters all abreast,\n  Who came as if just dropp'd down from the moon,\nTo Juan, who was nearest him, address'd\n  His thanks, and hopes to take the city soon,\nNot reckoning him to be a 'base Bezonian'\n(As Pistol calls it), but a young Livonian.\n\nJuan, to whom he spoke in German, knew\n  As much of German as of Sanscrit, and\nIn answer made an inclination to\n  The general who held him in command;\nFor seeing one with ribands, black and blue,\n  Stars, medals, and a bloody sword in hand,\nAddressing him in tones which seem'd to thank,\nHe recognised an officer of rank.\n\nShort speeches pass between two men who speak\n  No common language; and besides, in time\nOf war and taking towns, when many a shriek\n  Rings o'er the dialogue, and many a crime\nIs perpetrated ere a word can break\n  Upon the ear, and sounds of horror chime\nIn like church-bells, with sigh, howl, groan, yell, prayer,\nThere cannot be much conversation there.\n\nAnd therefore all we have related in\n  Two long octaves, pass'd in a little minute;\nBut in the same small minute, every sin\n  Contrived to get itself comprised within it.\nThe very cannon, deafen'd by the din,\n  Grew dumb, for you might almost hear a linnet,\nAs soon as thunder, 'midst the general noise\nOf human nature's agonising voice!\n\nThe town was enter'd. Oh eternity!-\n  'God made the country and man made the town,'\nSo Cowper says—and I begin to be\n  Of his opinion, when I see cast down\nRome, Babylon, Tyre, Carthage, Nineveh,\n  All walls men know, and many never known;\nAnd pondering on the present and the past,\nTo deem the woods shall be our home at last\n\nOf all men, saving Sylla the man-slayer,\n  Who passes for in life and death most lucky,\nOf the great names which in our faces stare,\n  The General Boon, back-woodsman of Kentucky,\nWas happiest amongst mortals anywhere;\n  For killing nothing but a bear or buck, he\nEnjoy'd the lonely, vigorous, harmless days\nOf his old age in wilds of deepest maze.\n\nCrime came not near him—she is not the child\n  Of solitude; Health shrank not from him—for\nHer home is in the rarely trodden wild,\n  Where if men seek her not, and death be more\nTheir choice than life, forgive them, as beguiled\n  By habit to what their own hearts abhor—\nIn cities caged. The present case in point I\nCite is, that Boon lived hunting up to ninety;\n\nAnd what 's still stranger, left behind a name\n  For which men vainly decimate the throng,\nNot only famous, but of that good fame,\n  Without which glory 's but a tavern song—\nSimple, serene, the antipodes of shame,\n  Which hate nor envy e'er could tinge with wrong;\nAn active hermit, even in age the child\nOf Nature, or the man of Ross run wild.\n\n'T is true he shrank from men even of his nation,\n  When they built up unto his darling trees,—\nHe moved some hundred miles off, for a station\n  Where there were fewer houses and more ease;\nThe inconvenience of civilisation\n  Is, that you neither can be pleased nor please;\nBut where he met the individual man,\nHe show'd himself as kind as mortal can.\n\nHe was not all alone: around him grew\n  A sylvan tribe of children of the chase,\nWhose young, unwaken'd world was ever new,\n  Nor sword nor sorrow yet had left a trace\nOn her unwrinkled brow, nor could you view\n  A frown on Nature's or on human face;\nThe free-born forest found and kept them free,\nAnd fresh as is a torrent or a tree.\n\nAnd tall, and strong, and swift of foot were they,\n  Beyond the dwarfing city's pale abortions,\nBecause their thoughts had never been the prey\n  Of care or gain: the green woods were their portions;\nNo sinking spirits told them they grew grey,\n  No fashion made them apes of her distortions;\nSimple they were, not savage; and their rifles,\nThough very true, were not yet used for trifles.\n\nMotion was in their days, rest in their slumbers,\n  And cheerfulness the handmaid of their toil;\nNor yet too many nor too few their numbers;\n  Corruption could not make their hearts her soil;\nThe lust which stings, the splendour which encumbers,\n  With the free foresters divide no spoil;\nSerene, not sullen, were the solitudes\nOf this unsighing people of the woods.\n\nSo much for Nature:—by way of variety,\n  Now back to thy great joys, Civilisation!\nAnd the sweet consequence of large society,\n  War, pestilence, the despot's desolation,\nThe kingly scourge, the lust of notoriety,\n  The millions slain by soldiers for their ration,\nThe scenes like Catherine's boudoir at threescore,\nWith Ismail's storm to soften it the more.\n\nThe town was enter'd: first one column made\n  Its sanguinary way good—then another;\nThe reeking bayonet and the flashing blade\n  Clash'd 'gainst the scimitar, and babe and mother\nWith distant shrieks were heard Heaven to upbraid:\n  Still closer sulphury clouds began to smother\nThe breath of morn and man, where foot by foot\nThe madden'd Turks their city still dispute.\n\nKoutousow, he who afterward beat back\n  (With some assistance from the frost and snow)\nNapoleon on his bold and bloody track,\n  It happen'd was himself beat back just now;\nHe was a jolly fellow, and could crack\n  His jest alike in face of friend or foe,\nThough life, and death, and victory were at stake;\nBut here it seem'd his jokes had ceased to take:\n\nFor having thrown himself into a ditch,\n  Follow'd in haste by various grenadiers,\nWhose blood the puddle greatly did enrich,\n  He climb'd to where the parapet appears;\nBut there his project reach'd its utmost pitch\n  ('Mongst other deaths the General Ribaupierre's\nWas much regretted), for the Moslem men\nThrew them all down into the ditch again.\n\nAnd had it not been for some stray troops landing\n  They knew not where, being carried by the stream\nTo some spot, where they lost their understanding,\n  And wander'd up and down as in a dream,\nUntil they reach'd, as daybreak was expanding,\n  That which a portal to their eyes did seem,—\nThe great and gay Koutousow might have lain\nWhere three parts of his column yet remain.\n\nAnd scrambling round the rampart, these same troops,\n  After the taking of the 'Cavalier,'\nJust as Koutousow's most 'forlorn' of 'hopes'\n  Took like chameleons some slight tinge of fear,\nOpen'd the gate call'd 'Kilia,' to the groups\n  Of baffled heroes, who stood shyly near,\nSliding knee-deep in lately frozen mud,\nNow thaw'd into a marsh of human blood.\n\nThe Kozacks, or, if so you please, Cossacques\n  (I don't much pique myself upon orthography,\nSo that I do not grossly err in facts,\n  Statistics, tactics, politics, and geography)—\nHaving been used to serve on horses' backs,\n  And no great dilettanti in topography\nOf fortresses, but fighting where it pleases\nTheir chiefs to order,—were all cut to pieces.\n\nTheir column, though the Turkish batteries thunder'd\n  Upon them, ne'ertheless had reach'd the rampart,\nAnd naturally thought they could have plunder'd\n  The city, without being farther hamper'd;\nBut as it happens to brave men, they blunder'd—\n  The Turks at first pretended to have scamper'd,\nOnly to draw them 'twixt two bastion corners,\nFrom whence they sallied on those Christian scorners.\n\nThen being taken by the tail—a taking\n  Fatal to bishops as to soldiers—these\nCossacques were all cut off as day was breaking,\n  And found their lives were let at a short lease—\nBut perish'd without shivering or shaking,\n  Leaving as ladders their heap'd carcasses,\nO'er which Lieutenant-Colonel Yesouskoi\nMarch'd with the brave battalion of Polouzki:—\n\nThis valiant man kill'd all the Turks he met,\n  But could not eat them, being in his turn\nSlain by some Mussulmans, who would not yet,\n  Without resistance, see their city burn.\nThe walls were won, but 't was an even bet\n  Which of the armies would have cause to mourn:\n'T was blow for blow, disputing inch by inch,\nFor one would not retreat, nor t' other flinch.\n\nAnother column also suffer'd much:—\n  And here we may remark with the historian,\nYou should but give few cartridges to such\n  Troops as are meant to march with greatest glory on:\nWhen matters must be carried by the touch\n  Of the bright bayonet, and they all should hurry on,\nThey sometimes, with a hankering for existence,\nKeep merely firing at a foolish distance.\n\nA junction of the General Meknop's men\n  (Without the General, who had fallen some time\nBefore, being badly seconded just then)\n  Was made at length with those who dared to climb\nThe death-disgorging rampart once again;\n  And though the Turk's resistance was sublime,\nThey took the bastion, which the Seraskier\nDefended at a price extremely dear.\n\nJuan and Johnson, and some volunteers,\n  Among the foremost, offer'd him good quarter,\nA word which little suits with Seraskiers,\n  Or at least suited not this valiant Tartar.\nHe died, deserving well his country's tears,\n  A savage sort of military martyr.\nAn English naval officer, who wish'd\nTo make him prisoner, was also dish'd:\n\nFor all the answer to his proposition\n  Was from a pistol-shot that laid him dead;\nOn which the rest, without more intermission,\n  Began to lay about with steel and lead—\nThe pious metals most in requisition\n  On such occasions: not a single head\nWas spared;—three thousand Moslems perish'd here,\nAnd sixteen bayonets pierced the Seraskier.\n\nThe city 's taken—only part by part—\n  And death is drunk with gore: there 's not a street\nWhere fights not to the last some desperate heart\n  For those for whom it soon shall cease to beat.\nHere War forgot his own destructive art\n  In more destroying Nature; and the heat\nOf carnage, like the Nile's sun-sodden slime,\nEngender'd monstrous shapes of every crime.\n\nA Russian officer, in martial tread\n  Over a heap of bodies, felt his heel\nSeized fast, as if 't were by the serpent's head\n  Whose fangs Eve taught her human seed to feel:\nIn vain he kick'd, and swore, and writhed, and bled,\n  And howl'd for help as wolves do for a meal—\nThe teeth still kept their gratifying hold,\nAs do the subtle snakes described of old.\n\nA dying Moslem, who had felt the foot\n  Of a foe o'er him, snatch'd at it, and bit\nThe very tendon which is most acute\n  (That which some ancient Muse or modern wit\nNamed after thee, Achilles), and quite through 't\n  He made the teeth meet, nor relinquish'd it\nEven with his life—for (but they lie) 't is said\nTo the live leg still clung the sever'd head.\n\nHowever this may be, 't is pretty sure\n  The Russian officer for life was lamed,\nFor the Turk's teeth stuck faster than a skewer,\n  And left him 'midst the invalid and maim'd:\nThe regimental surgeon could not cure\n  His patient, and perhaps was to be blamed\nMore than the head of the inveterate foe,\nWhich was cut off, and scarce even then let go.\n\nBut then the fact 's a fact—and 't is the part\n  Of a true poet to escape from fiction\nWhene'er he can; for there is little art\n  In leaving verse more free from the restriction\nOf truth than prose, unless to suit the mart\n  For what is sometimes called poetic diction,\nAnd that outrageous appetite for lies\nWhich Satan angles with for souls, like flies.\n\nThe city 's taken, but not render'd!—No!\n  There 's not a Moslem that hath yielded sword:\nThe blood may gush out, as the Danube's flow\n  Rolls by the city wall; but deed nor word\nAcknowledge aught of dread of death or foe:\n  In vain the yell of victory is roar'd\nBy the advancing Muscovite—the groan\nOf the last foe is echoed by his own.\n\nThe bayonet pierces and the sabre cleaves,\n  And human lives are lavish'd everywhere,\nAs the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves\n  When the stripp'd forest bows to the bleak air,\nAnd groans; and thus the peopled city grieves,\n  Shorn of its best and loveliest, and left bare;\nBut still it falls in vast and awful splinters,\nAs oaks blown down with all their thousand winters.\n\nIt is an awful topic—but 't is not\n  My cue for any time to be terrific:\nFor checker'd as is seen our human lot\n  With good, and bad, and worse, alike prolific\nOf melancholy merriment, to quote\n  Too much of one sort would be soporific;—\nWithout, or with, offence to friends or foes,\nI sketch your world exactly as it goes.\n\nAnd one good action in the midst of crimes\n  Is 'quite refreshing,' in the affected phrase\nOf these ambrosial, Pharisaic times,\n  With all their pretty milk-and-water ways,\nAnd may serve therefore to bedew these rhymes,\n  A little scorch'd at present with the blaze\nOf conquest and its consequences, which\nMake epic poesy so rare and rich.\n\nUpon a taken bastion, where there lay\n  Thousands of slaughter'd men, a yet warm group\nOf murder'd women, who had found their way\n  To this vain refuge, made the good heart droop\nAnd shudder;—while, as beautiful as May,\n  A female child of ten years tried to stoop\nAnd hide her little palpitating breast\nAmidst the bodies lull'd in bloody rest.\n\nTwo villainous Cossacques pursued the child\n  With flashing eyes and weapons: match'd with them,\nThe rudest brute that roams Siberia's wild\n  Has feelings pure and polish'd as a gem,—\nThe bear is civilised, the wolf is mild;\n  And whom for this at last must we condemn?\nTheir natures? or their sovereigns, who employ\nAll arts to teach their subjects to destroy?\n\nTheir sabres glitter'd o'er her little head,\n  Whence her fair hair rose twining with affright,\nHer hidden face was plunged amidst the dead:\n  When Juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight,\nI shall not say exactly what he said,\n  Because it might not solace 'ears polite;'\nBut what he did, was to lay on their backs,\nThe readiest way of reasoning with Cossacques.\n\nOne's hip he slash'd, and split the other's shoulder,\n  And drove them with their brutal yells to seek\nIf there might be chirurgeons who could solder\n  The wounds they richly merited, and shriek\nTheir baffled rage and pain; while waxing colder\n  As he turn'd o'er each pale and gory cheek,\nDon Juan raised his little captive from\nThe heap a moment more had made her tomb.\n\nAnd she was chill as they, and on her face\n  A slender streak of blood announced how near\nHer fate had been to that of all her race;\n  For the same blow which laid her mother here\nHad scarr'd her brow, and left its crimson trace,\n  As the last link with all she had held dear;\nBut else unhurt, she open'd her large eyes,\nAnd gazed on Juan with a wild surprise.\n\nJust at this instant, while their eyes were fix'd\n  Upon each other, with dilated glance,\nIn Juan's look, pain, pleasure, hope, fear, mix'd\n  With joy to save, and dread of some mischance\nUnto his protege; while hers, transfix'd\n  With infant terrors, glared as from a trance,\nA pure, transparent, pale, yet radiant face,\nLike to a lighted alabaster vase;—\n\nUp came John Johnson (I will not say 'Jack,'\n  For that were vulgar, cold, and commonplace\nOn great occasions, such as an attack\n  On cities, as hath been the present case):\nUp Johnson came, with hundreds at his back,\n  Exclaiming;—'Juan! Juan! On, boy! brace\nYour arm, and I 'll bet Moscow to a dollar\nThat you and I will win St. George's collar.\n\n'The Seraskier is knock'd upon the head,\n  But the stone bastion still remains, wherein\nThe old Pacha sits among some hundreds dead,\n  Smoking his pipe quite calmly 'midst the din\nOf our artillery and his own: 't is said\n  Our kill'd, already piled up to the chin,\nLie round the battery; but still it batters,\nAnd grape in volleys, like a vineyard, scatters.\n\n'Then up with me!'—But Juan answer'd, 'Look\n  Upon this child—I saved her—must not leave\nHer life to chance; but point me out some nook\n  Of safety, where she less may shrink and grieve,\nAnd I am with you.'—Whereon Johnson took\n  A glance around—and shrugg'd—and twitch'd his sleeve\nAnd black silk neckcloth—and replied, 'You 're right;\nPoor thing! what 's to be done? I 'm puzzled quite.'\n\nSaid Juan: 'Whatsoever is to be\n  Done, I 'll not quit her till she seems secure\nOf present life a good deal more than we.'\n  Quoth Johnson: 'Neither will I quite ensure;\nBut at the least you may die gloriously.'\n  Juan replied: 'At least I will endure\nWhate'er is to be borne—but not resign\nThis child, who is parentless, and therefore mine.'\n\nJohnson said: 'Juan, we 've no time to lose;\n  The child 's a pretty child—a very pretty—\nI never saw such eyes—but hark! now choose\n  Between your fame and feelings, pride and pity;—\nHark! how the roar increases!—no excuse\n  Will serve when there is plunder in a city;—\nI should be loth to march without you, but,\nBy God! we 'll be too late for the first cut.'\n\nBut Juan was immovable; until\n  Johnson, who really loved him in his way,\nPick'd out amongst his followers with some skill\n  Such as he thought the least given up to prey;\nAnd swearing if the infant came to ill\n  That they should all be shot on the next day;\nBut if she were deliver'd safe and sound,\nThey should at least have fifty rubles round,\n\nAnd all allowances besides of plunder\n  In fair proportion with their comrades;—then\nJuan consented to march on through thunder,\n  Which thinn'd at every step their ranks of men:\nAnd yet the rest rush'd eagerly—no wonder,\n  For they were heated by the hope of gain,\nA thing which happens everywhere each day—\nNo hero trusteth wholly to half pay.\n\nAnd such is victory, and such is man!\n  At least nine tenths of what we call so;—God\nMay have another name for half we scan\n  As human beings, or his ways are odd.\nBut to our subject: a brave Tartar khan—\n  Or 'sultan,' as the author (to whose nod\nIn prose I bend my humble verse) doth call\nThis chieftain—somehow would not yield at all:\n\nBut flank'd by five brave sons (such is polygamy,\n  That she spawns warriors by the score, where none\nAre prosecuted for that false crime bigamy),\n  He never would believe the city won\nWhile courage clung but to a single twig.—Am I\n  Describing Priam's, Peleus', or Jove's son?\nNeither—but a good, plain, old, temperate man,\nWho fought with his five children in the van.\n\nTo take him was the point. The truly brave,\n  When they behold the brave oppress'd with odds,\nAre touch'd with a desire to shield and save;—\n  A mixture of wild beasts and demigods\nAre they—now furious as the sweeping wave,\n  Now moved with pity: even as sometimes nods\nThe rugged tree unto the summer wind,\nCompassion breathes along the savage mind.\n\nBut he would not be taken, and replied\n  To all the propositions of surrender\nBy mowing Christians down on every side,\n  As obstinate as Swedish Charles at Bender.\nHis five brave boys no less the foe defied;\n  Whereon the Russian pathos grew less tender,\nAs being a virtue, like terrestrial patience,\nApt to wear out on trifling provocations.\n\nAnd spite of Johnson and of Juan, who\n  Expended all their Eastern phraseology\nIn begging him, for God's sake, just to show\n  So much less fight as might form an apology\nFor them in saving such a desperate foe—\n  He hew'd away, like doctors of theology\nWhen they dispute with sceptics; and with curses\nStruck at his friends, as babies beat their nurses.\n\nNay, he had wounded, though but slightly, both\n  Juan and Johnson; whereupon they fell,\nThe first with sighs, the second with an oath,\n  Upon his angry sultanship, pell-mell,\nAnd all around were grown exceeding wroth\n  At such a pertinacious infidel,\nAnd pour'd upon him and his sons like rain,\nWhich they resisted like a sandy plain\n\nThat drinks and still is dry. At last they perish'd—\n  His second son was levell'd by a shot;\nHis third was sabred; and the fourth, most cherish'd\n  Of all the five, on bayonets met his lot;\nThe fifth, who, by a Christian mother nourish'd,\n  Had been neglected, ill-used, and what not,\nBecause deform'd, yet died all game and bottom,\nTo save a sire who blush'd that he begot him.\n\nThe eldest was a true and tameless Tartar,\n  As great a scorner of the Nazarene\nAs ever Mahomet pick'd out for a martyr,\n  Who only saw the black-eyed girls in green,\nWho make the beds of those who won't take quarter\n  On earth, in Paradise; and when once seen,\nThose houris, like all other pretty creatures,\nDo just whate'er they please, by dint of features.\n\nAnd what they pleased to do with the young khan\n  In heaven I know not, nor pretend to guess;\nBut doubtless they prefer a fine young man\n  To tough old heroes, and can do no less;\nAnd that 's the cause no doubt why, if we scan\n  A field of battle's ghastly wilderness,\nFor one rough, weather-beaten, veteran body,\nYou 'll find ten thousand handsome coxcombs bloody.\n\nYour houris also have a natural pleasure\n  In lopping off your lately married men,\nBefore the bridal hours have danced their measure\n  And the sad, second moon grows dim again,\nOr dull repentance hath had dreary leisure\n  To wish him back a bachelor now and then.\nAnd thus your houri (it may be) disputes\nOf these brief blossoms the immediate fruits.\n\nThus the young khan, with houris in his sight,\n  Thought not upon the charms of four young brides,\nBut bravely rush'd on his first heavenly night.\n  In short, howe'er our better faith derides,\nThese black-eyed virgins make the Moslems fight,\n  As though there were one heaven and none besides,—\nWhereas, if all be true we hear of heaven\nAnd hell, there must at least be six or seven.\n\nSo fully flash'd the phantom on his eyes,\n  That when the very lance was in his heart,\nHe shouted 'Allah!' and saw Paradise\n  With all its veil of mystery drawn apart,\nAnd bright eternity without disguise\n  On his soul, like a ceaseless sunrise, dart:—\nWith prophets, houris, angels, saints, descried\nIn one voluptuous blaze,—and then he died,\n\nBut with a heavenly rapture on his face.\n  The good old khan, who long had ceased to see\nHouris, or aught except his florid race\n  Who grew like cedars round him gloriously—\nWhen he beheld his latest hero grace\n  The earth, which he became like a fell'd tree,\nPaused for a moment, from the fight, and cast\nA glance on that slain son, his first and last.\n\nThe soldiers, who beheld him drop his point,\n  Stopp'd as if once more willing to concede\nQuarter, in case he bade them not 'aroynt!'\n  As he before had done. He did not heed\nTheir pause nor signs: his heart was out of joint,\n  And shook (till now unshaken) like a reed,\nAs he look'd down upon his children gone,\nAnd felt—though done with life—he was alone\n\nBut 't was a transient tremor;—with a spring\n  Upon the Russian steel his breast he flung,\nAs carelessly as hurls the moth her wing\n  Against the light wherein she dies: he clung\nCloser, that all the deadlier they might wring,\n  Unto the bayonets which had pierced his young;\nAnd throwing back a dim look on his sons,\nIn one wide wound pour'd forth his soul at once.\n\n'T is strange enough—the rough, tough soldiers, who\n  Spared neither sex nor age in their career\nOf carnage, when this old man was pierced through,\n  And lay before them with his children near,\nTouch'd by the heroism of him they slew,\n  Were melted for a moment: though no tear\nFlow'd from their bloodshot eyes, all red with strife,\nThey honour'd such determined scorn of life.\n\nBut the stone bastion still kept up its fire,\n  Where the chief pacha calmly held his post:\nSome twenty times he made the Russ retire,\n  And baffled the assaults of all their host;\nAt length he condescended to inquire\n  If yet the city's rest were won or lost;\nAnd being told the latter, sent a bey\nTo answer Ribas' summons to give way.\n\nIn the mean time, cross-legg'd, with great sang-froid,\n  Among the scorching ruins he sat smoking\nTobacco on a little carpet;—Troy\n  Saw nothing like the scene around:—yet looking\nWith martial stoicism, nought seem'd to annoy\n  His stern philosophy; but gently stroking\nHis beard, he puff'd his pipe's ambrosial gales,\nAs if he had three lives, as well as tails.\n\nThe town was taken—whether he might yield\n  Himself or bastion, little matter'd now:\nHis stubborn valour was no future shield.\n  Ismail 's no more! The crescent's silver bow\nSunk, and the crimson cross glared o'er the field,\n  But red with no redeeming gore: the glow\nOf burning streets, like moonlight on the water,\nWas imaged back in blood, the sea of slaughter.\n\nAll that the mind would shrink from of excesses;\n  All that the body perpetrates of bad;\nAll that we read, hear, dream, of man's distresses;\n  All that the devil would do if run stark mad;\nAll that defies the worst which pen expresses;\n  All by which hell is peopled, or as sad\nAs hell—mere mortals who their power abuse—\nWas here (as heretofore and since) let loose.\n\nIf here and there some transient trait of pity\n  Was shown, and some more noble heart broke through\nIts bloody bond, and saved perhaps some pretty\n  Child, or an aged, helpless man or two—\nWhat 's this in one annihilated city,\n  Where thousand loves, and ties, and duties grew?\nCockneys of London! Muscadins of Paris!\nJust ponder what a pious pastime war is.\n\nThink how the joys of reading a Gazette\n  Are purchased by all agonies and crimes:\nOr if these do not move you, don't forget\n  Such doom may be your own in aftertimes.\nMeantime the Taxes, Castlereagh, and Debt,\n  Are hints as good as sermons, or as rhymes.\nRead your own hearts and Ireland's present story,\nThen feed her famine fat with Wellesley's glory.\n\nBut still there is unto a patriot nation,\n  Which loves so well its country and its king,\nA subject of sublimest exultation—\n  Bear it, ye Muses, on your brightest wing!\nHowe'er the mighty locust, Desolation,\n  Strip your green fields, and to your harvests cling,\nGaunt famine never shall approach the throne—\nThough Ireland starve, great George weighs twenty stone.\n\nBut let me put an end unto my theme:\n  There was an end of Ismail—hapless town!\nFar flash'd her burning towers o'er Danube's stream,\n  And redly ran his blushing waters down.\nThe horrid war-whoop and the shriller scream\n  Rose still; but fainter were the thunders grown:\nOf forty thousand who had mann'd the wall,\nSome hundreds breathed—the rest were silent all!\n\nIn one thing ne'ertheless 't is fit to praise\n  The Russian army upon this occasion,\nA virtue much in fashion now-a-days,\n  And therefore worthy of commemoration:\nThe topic 's tender, so shall be my phrase—\n  Perhaps the season's chill, and their long station\nIn winter's depth, or want of rest and victual,\nHad made them chaste;—they ravish'd very little.\n\nMuch did they slay, more plunder, and no less\n  Might here and there occur some violation\nIn the other line;—but not to such excess\n  As when the French, that dissipated nation,\nTake towns by storm: no causes can I guess,\n  Except cold weather and commiseration;\nBut all the ladies, save some twenty score,\nWere almost as much virgins as before.\n\nSome odd mistakes, too, happen'd in the dark,\n  Which show'd a want of lanterns, or of taste—\nIndeed the smoke was such they scarce could mark\n  Their friends from foes,—besides such things from haste\nOccur, though rarely, when there is a spark\n  Of light to save the venerably chaste:\nBut six old damsels, each of seventy years,\nWere all deflower'd by different grenadiers.\n\nBut on the whole their continence was great;\n  So that some disappointment there ensued\nTo those who had felt the inconvenient state\n  Of 'single blessedness,' and thought it good\n(Since it was not their fault, but only fate,\n  To bear these crosses) for each waning prude\nTo make a Roman sort of Sabine wedding,\nWithout the expense and the suspense of bedding.\n\nSome voices of the buxom middle-aged\n  Were also heard to wonder in the din\n(Widows of forty were these birds long caged)\n  'Wherefore the ravishing did not begin!'\nBut while the thirst for gore and plunder raged,\n  There was small leisure for superfluous sin;\nBut whether they escaped or no, lies hid\nIn darkness—I can only hope they did.\n\nSuwarrow now was conqueror—a match\n  For Timour or for Zinghis in his trade.\nWhile mosques and streets, beneath his eyes, like thatch\n  Blazed, and the cannon's roar was scarce allay'd,\nWith bloody hands he wrote his first despatch;\n  And here exactly follows what he said:—\n'Glory to God and to the Empress!' (Powers\nEternal! such names mingled!) 'Ismail 's ours.'\n\nMethinks these are the most tremendous words,\n  Since 'Mene, Mene, Tekel,' and 'Upharsin,'\nWhich hands or pens have ever traced of swords.\n  Heaven help me! I 'm but little of a parson:\nWhat Daniel read was short-hand of the Lord's,\n  Severe, sublime; the prophet wrote no farce on\nThe fate of nations;—but this Russ so witty\nCould rhyme, like Nero, o'er a burning city.\n\nHe wrote this Polar melody, and set it,\n  Duly accompanied by shrieks and groans,\nWhich few will sing, I trust, but none forget it—\n  For I will teach, if possible, the stones\nTo rise against earth's tyrants. Never let it\n  Be said that we still truckle unto thrones;—\nBut ye—our children's children! think how we\nShow'd what things were before the world was free!\n\nThat hour is not for us, but 't is for you:\n  And as, in the great joy of your millennium,\nYou hardly will believe such things were true\n  As now occur, I thought that I would pen you 'em;\nBut may their very memory perish too!-\n  Yet if perchance remember'd, still disdain you 'em\nMore than you scorn the savages of yore,\nWho painted their bare limbs, but not with gore.\n\nAnd when you hear historians talk of thrones,\n  And those that sate upon them, let it be\nAs we now gaze upon the mammoth's bones,\n  'And wonder what old world such things could see,\nOr hieroglyphics on Egyptian stones,\n  The pleasant riddles of futurity—\nGuessing at what shall happily be hid,\nAs the real purpose of a pyramid.\n\nReader! I have kept my word,—at least so far\n  As the first Canto promised. You have now\nHad sketches of love, tempest, travel, war—\n  All very accurate, you must allow,\nAnd epic, if plain truth should prove no bar;\n  For I have drawn much less with a long bow\nThan my forerunners. Carelessly I sing,\nBut Phoebus lends me now and then a string,\n\nWith which I still can harp, and carp, and fiddle.\n  What farther hath befallen or may befall\nThe hero of this grand poetic riddle,\n  I by and by may tell you, if at all:\nBut now I choose to break off in the middle,\n  Worn out with battering Ismail's stubborn wall,\nWhile Juan is sent off with the despatch,\nFor which all Petersburgh is on the watch.\n\nThis special honour was conferr'd, because\n  He had behaved with courage and humanity—\nWhich last men like, when they have time to pause\n  From their ferocities produced by vanity.\nHis little captive gain'd him some applause\n  For saving her amidst the wild insanity\nOf carnage,—and I think he was more glad in her\nSafety, than his new order of St. Vladimir.\n\nThe Moslem orphan went with her protector,\n  For she was homeless, houseless, helpless; all\nHer friends, like the sad family of Hector,\n  Had perish'd in the field or by the wall:\nHer very place of birth was but a spectre\n  Of what it had been; there the Muezzin's cal\nTo prayer was heard no more!—and Juan wept,\nAnd made a vow to shield her, which he kept.</code>"

(or 'Villainton'—for Fame\n  Sounds the heroic syllables both ways;\nFrance could not even conquer your great name,\n  But punn'd it down to this facetious phrase—\nBeating or beaten she will laugh the same),\n  You have obtain'd great pensions and much praise:\nGlory like yours should any dare gainsay,\nHumanity would rise, and thunder 'Nay!'\n\nI don't think that you used Kinnaird quite well\n  In Marinet's affair—in fact, 't was shabby,\nAnd like some other things won't do to tell\n  Upon your tomb in Westminster's old abbey.\nUpon the rest 't is not worth while to dwell,\n  Such tales being for the tea-hours of some tabby;\nBut though your years as man tend fast to zero,\nIn fact your grace is still but a young hero.\n\nThough Britain owes (and pays you too) so much,\n  Yet Europe doubtless owes you greatly more:\nYou have repair'd Legitimacy's crutch,\n  A prop not quite so certain as before:\nThe Spanish, and the French, as well as Dutch,\n  Have seen, and felt, how strongly you restore;\nAnd Waterloo has made the world your debtor\n(I wish your bards would sing it rather better).\n\nYou are 'the best of cut-throats:'—do not start;\n  The phrase is Shakspeare's, and not misapplied:\nWar 's a brain-spattering, windpipe-slitting art,\n  Unless her cause by right be sanctified.\nIf you have acted once a generous part,\n  The world, not the world's masters, will decide,\nAnd I shall be delighted to learn who,\nSave you and yours, have gain'd by Waterloo?\n\nI am no flatterer—you 've supp'd full of flattery:\n  They say you like it too—'t is no great wonder.\nHe whose whole life has been assault and battery,\n  At last may get a little tired of thunder;\nAnd swallowing eulogy much more than satire, he\n  May like being praised for every lucky blunder,\nCall'd 'Saviour of the Nations'—not yet saved,\nAnd 'Europe's Liberator'—still enslaved.\n\nI 've done. Now go and dine from off the plate\n  Presented by the Prince of the Brazils,\nAnd send the sentinel before your gate\n  A slice or two from your luxurious meals:\nHe fought, but has not fed so well of late.\n  Some hunger, too, they say the people feels:—\nThere is no doubt that you deserve your ration,\nBut pray give back a little to the nation.\n\nI don't mean to reflect—a man so great as\n  You, my lord duke! is far above reflection:\nThe high Roman fashion, too, of Cincinnatus,\n  With modern history has but small connection:\nThough as an Irishman you love potatoes,\n  You need not take them under your direction;\nAnd half a million for your Sabine farm\nIs rather dear!—I 'm sure I mean no harm.\n\nGreat men have always scorn'd great recompenses:\n  Epaminondas saved his Thebes, and died,\nNot leaving even his funeral expenses:\n  George Washington had thanks and nought beside,\nExcept the all-cloudless glory which few men's is\n  To free his country: Pitt too had his pride,\nAnd as a high-soul'd minister of state is\nRenown'd for ruining Great Britain gratis.\n\nNever had mortal man such opportunity,\n  Except Napoleon, or abused it more:\nYou might have freed fallen Europe from the unity\n  Of tyrants, and been blest from shore to shore:\nAnd now—what is your fame? Shall the Muse tune it ye?\n  Now—that the rabble's first vain shouts are o'er?\nGo! hear it in your famish'd country's cries!\nBehold the world! and curse your victories!\n\nAs these new cantos touch on warlike feats,\n  To you the unflattering Muse deigns to inscribe\nTruths, that you will not read in the Gazettes,\n  But which 't is time to teach the hireling tribe\nWho fatten on their country's gore, and debts,\n  Must be recited, and—without a bribe.\nYou did great things; but not being great in mind,\nHave left undone the greatest—and mankind.\n\nDeath laughs—Go ponder o'er the skeleton\n  With which men image out the unknown thing\nThat hides the past world, like to a set sun\n  Which still elsewhere may rouse a brighter spring—\nDeath laughs at all you weep for:—look upon\n  This hourly dread of all! whose threaten'd sting\nTurns life to terror, even though in its sheath:\nMark how its lipless mouth grins without breath!\n\nMark how it laughs and scorns at all you are!\n  And yet was what you are: from ear to ear\nIt laughs not—there is now no fleshy bar\n  So call'd; the Antic long hath ceased to hear,\nBut still he smiles; and whether near or far,\n  He strips from man that mantle (far more dear\nThan even the tailor's), his incarnate skin,\nWhite, black, or copper—the dead bones will grin.\n\nAnd thus Death laughs,—it is sad merriment,\n  But still it is so; and with such example\nWhy should not Life be equally content\n  With his superior, in a smile to trample\nUpon the nothings which are daily spent\n  Like bubbles on an ocean much less ample\nThan the eternal deluge, which devours\nSuns as rays—worlds like atoms—years like hours?\n\n'To be, or not to be? that is the question,'\n  Says Shakspeare, who just now is much in fashion.\nI am neither Alexander nor Hephaestion,\n  Nor ever had for abstract fame much passion;\nBut would much rather have a sound digestion\n  Than Buonaparte's cancer: could I dash on\nThrough fifty victories to shame or fame—\nWithout a stomach what were a good name?\n\n'O dura ilia messorum!'—'Oh\n  Ye rigid guts of reapers!' I translate\nFor the great benefit of those who know\n  What indigestion is—that inward fate\nWhich makes all Styx through one small liver flow.\n  A peasant's sweat is worth his lord's estate:\nLet this one toil for bread—that rack for rent,\nHe who sleeps best may be the most content.\n\n'To be, or not to be?'—Ere I decide,\n  I should be glad to know that which is being?\n'T is true we speculate both far and wide,\n  And deem, because we see, we are all-seeing:\nFor my part, I 'll enlist on neither side,\n  Until I see both sides for once agreeing.\nFor me, I sometimes think that life is death,\nRather than life a mere affair of breath.\n\n'Que scais-je?' was the motto of Montaigne,\n  As also of the first academicians:\nThat all is dubious which man may attain,\n  Was one of their most favourite positions.\nThere 's no such thing as certainty, that 's plain\n  As any of Mortality's conditions;\nSo little do we know what we 're about in\nThis world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.\n\nIt is a pleasant voyage perhaps to float,\n  Like Pyrrho, on a sea of speculation;\nBut what if carrying sail capsize the boat?\n  Your wise men don't know much of navigation;\nAnd swimming long in the abyss of thought\n  Is apt to tire: a calm and shallow station\nWell nigh the shore, where one stoops down and gathers\nSome pretty shell, is best for moderate bathers.\n\n'But heaven,' as Cassio says, 'is above all—\n  No more of this, then,—let us pray!' We have\nSouls to save, since Eve's slip and Adam's fall,\n  Which tumbled all mankind into the grave,\nBesides fish, beasts, and birds. 'The sparrow's fall\n  Is special providence,' though how it gave\nOffence, we know not; probably it perch'd\nUpon the tree which Eve so fondly search'd.\n\nO, ye immortal gods! what is theogony?\n  O, thou too, mortal man! what is philanthropy?\nO, world! which was and is, what is cosmogony?\n  Some people have accused me of misanthropy;\nAnd yet I know no more than the mahogany\n  That forms this desk, of what they mean; lykanthropy\nI comprehend, for without transformation\nMen become wolves on any slight occasion.\n\nBut I, the mildest, meekest of mankind,\n  Like Moses, or Melancthon, who have ne'er\nDone anything exceedingly unkind,—\n  And (though I could not now and then forbear\nFollowing the bent of body or of mind)\n  Have always had a tendency to spare,—\nWhy do they call me misanthrope? Because\nThey hate me, not I them.—and here we 'll pause.\n\n'T is time we should proceed with our good poem,—\n  For I maintain that it is really good,\nNot only in the body but the proem,\n  However little both are understood\nJust now,—but by and by the Truth will show 'em\n  Herself in her sublimest attitude:\nAnd till she doth, I fain must be content\nTo share her beauty and her banishment.\n\nOur hero (and, I trust, kind reader, yours)\n  Was left upon his way to the chief city\nOf the immortal Peter's polish'd boors\n  Who still have shown themselves more brave than witty.\nI know its mighty empire now allures\n  Much flattery—even Voltaire's, and that 's a pity.\nFor me, I deem an absolute autocrat\nNot a barbarian, but much worse than that.\n\nAnd I will war, at least in words (and—should\n  My chance so happen—deeds), with all who war\nWith Thought;—and of Thought's foes by far most rude,\n  Tyrants and sycophants have been and are.\nI know not who may conquer: if I could\n  Have such a prescience, it should be no bar\nTo this my plain, sworn, downright detestation\nOf every depotism in every nation.\n\nIt is not that I adulate the people:\n  Without me, there are demagogues enough,\nAnd infidels, to pull down every steeple,\n  And set up in their stead some proper stuff.\nWhether they may sow scepticism to reap hell,\n  As is the Christian dogma rather rough,\nI do not know;—I wish men to be free\nAs much from mobs as kings—from you as me.\n\nThe consequence is, being of no party,\n  I shall offend all parties: never mind!\nMy words, at least, are more sincere and hearty\n  Than if I sought to sail before the wind.\nHe who has nought to gain can have small art: he\n  Who neither wishes to be bound nor bind,\nMay still expatiate freely, as will I,\nNor give my voice to slavery's jackal cry.\n\nThat 's an appropriate simile, that jackal;—\n  I 've heard them in the Ephesian ruins howl\nBy night, as do that mercenary pack all,\n  Power's base purveyors, who for pickings prowl,\nAnd scent the prey their masters would attack all.\n  However, the poor jackals are less foul\n(As being the brave lions' keen providers)\nThan human insects, catering for spiders.\n\nRaise but an arm! 't will brush their web away,\n  And without that, their poison and their claws\nAre useless. Mind, good people! what I say\n  (Or rather peoples)—go on without pause!\nThe web of these tarantulas each day\n  Increases, till you shall make common cause:\nNone, save the Spanish fly and Attic bee,\nAs yet are strongly stinging to be free.\n\nDon Juan, who had shone in the late slaughter,\n  Was left upon his way with the despatch,\nWhere blood was talk'd of as we would of water;\n  And carcasses that lay as thick as thatch\nO'er silenced cities, merely served to flatter\n  Fair Catherine's pastime—who look'd on the match\nBetween these nations as a main of cocks,\nWherein she liked her own to stand like rocks.\n\nAnd there in a kibitka he roll'd on\n  (A cursed sort of carriage without springs,\nWhich on rough roads leaves scarcely a whole bone),\n  Pondering on glory, chivalry, and kings,\nAnd orders, and on all that he had done—\n  And wishing that post-horses had the wings\nOf Pegasus, or at the least post-chaises\nHad feathers, when a traveller on deep ways is.\n\nAt every jolt—and they were many—still\n  He turn'd his eyes upon his little charge,\nAs if he wish'd that she should fare less ill\n  Than he, in these sad highways left at large\nTo ruts, and flints, and lovely Nature's skill,\n  Who is no paviour, nor admits a barge\nOn her canals, where God takes sea and land,\nFishery and farm, both into his own hand.\n\nAt least he pays no rent, and has best right\n  To be the first of what we used to call\n'Gentlemen farmer'—a race worn out quite,\n  Since lately there have been no rents at all,\nAnd 'gentlemen' are in a piteous plight,\n  And 'farmers' can't raise Ceres from her fall:\nShe fell with Buonaparte—What strange thoughts\nArise, when we see emperors fall with oats!\n\nBut Juan turn'd his eyes on the sweet child\n  Whom he had saved from slaughter—what a trophy\nO! ye who build up monuments, defiled\n  With gore, like Nadir Shah, that costive sophy,\nWho, after leaving Hindostan a wild,\n  And scarce to the Mogul a cup of coffee\nTo soothe his woes withal, was slain, the sinner!\nBecause he could no more digest his dinner;—\n\nO ye! or we! or he! or she! reflect,\n  That one life saved, especially if young\nOr pretty, is a thing to recollect\n  Far sweeter than the greenest laurels sprung\nFrom the manure of human clay, though deck'd\n  With all the praises ever said or sung:\nThough hymn'd by every harp, unless within\nYour heart joins chorus, Fame is but a din.\n\nO! ye great authors luminous, voluminous!\n  Ye twice ten hundred thousand daily scribes!\nWhose pamphlets, volumes, newspapers, illumine us!\n  Whether you 're paid by government in bribes,\nTo prove the public debt is not consuming us—\n  Or, roughly treading on the 'courtier's kibes'\nWith clownish heel, your popular circulation\nFeeds you by printing half the realm's starvation;—\n\nO, ye great authors!—'Apropos des bottes,'-\n  I have forgotten what I meant to say,\nAs sometimes have been greater sages' lots;\n  'T was something calculated to allay\nAll wrath in barracks, palaces, or cots:\n  Certes it would have been but thrown away,\nAnd that 's one comfort for my lost advice,\nAlthough no doubt it was beyond all price.\n\nBut let it go:—it will one day be found\n  With other relics of 'a former world,'\nWhen this world shall be former, underground,\n  Thrown topsy-turvy, twisted, crisp'd, and curl'd,\nBaked, fried, or burnt, turn'd inside-out, or drown'd,\n  Like all the worlds before, which have been hurl'd\nFirst out of, and then back again to chaos,\nThe superstratum which will overlay us.\n\nSo Cuvier says;—and then shall come again\n  Unto the new creation, rising out\nFrom our old crash, some mystic, ancient strain\n  Of things destroy'd and left in airy doubt:\nLike to the notions we now entertain\n  Of Titans, giants, fellows of about\nSome hundred feet in height, not to say miles,\nAnd mammoths, and your winged crocodiles.\n\nThink if then George the Fourth should be dug up!\n  How the new worldlings of the then new East\nWill wonder where such animals could sup!\n  (For they themselves will be but of the least:\nEven worlds miscarry, when too oft they pup,\n  And every new creation hath decreased\nIn size, from overworking the material—\nMen are but maggots of some huge Earth's burial.)\n\nHow will—to these young people, just thrust out\n  From some fresh Paradise, and set to plough,\nAnd dig, and sweat, and turn themselves about,\n  And plant, and reap, and spin, and grind, and sow,\nTill all the arts at length are brought about,\n  Especially of war and taxing,—how,\nI say, will these great relics, when they see 'em,\nLook like the monsters of a new museum?\n\nBut I am apt to grow too metaphysical:\n  'The time is out of joint,'—and so am I;\nI quite forget this poem 's merely quizzical,\n  And deviate into matters rather dry.\nI ne'er decide what I shall say, and this I cal\n  Much too poetical: men should know why\nThey write, and for what end; but, note or text,\nI never know the word which will come next.\n\nSo on I ramble, now and then narrating,\n  Now pondering:—it is time we should narrate.\nI left Don Juan with his horses baiting—\n  Now we 'll get o'er the ground at a great rate.\nI shall not be particular in stating\n  His journey, we 've so many tours of late:\nSuppose him then at Petersburgh; suppose\nThat pleasant capital of painted snows;\n\nSuppose him in a handsome uniform,—\n  A scarlet coat, black facings, a long plume,\nWaving, like sails new shiver'd in a storm,\n  Over a cock'd hat in a crowded room,\nAnd brilliant breeches, bright as a Cairn Gorme,\n  Of yellow casimere we may presume,\nWhite stocking drawn uncurdled as new milk\nO'er limbs whose symmetry set off the silk;\n\nSuppose him sword by side, and hat in hand,\n  Made up by youth, fame, and an army tailor—\nThat great enchanter, at whose rod's command\n  Beauty springs forth, and Nature's self turns paler,\nSeeing how Art can make her work more grand\n  (When she don't pin men's limbs in like a gaoler),—\nBehold him placed as if upon a pillar! He\nSeems Love turn'd a lieutenant of artillery:—\n\nHis bandage slipp'd down into a cravat;\n  His wings subdued to epaulettes; his quiver\nShrunk to a scabbard, with his arrows at\n  His side as a small sword, but sharp as ever;\nHis bow converted into a cock'd hat;\n  But still so like, that Psyche were more clever\nThan some wives (who make blunders no less stupid),\nIf she had not mistaken him for Cupid.\n\nThe courtiers stared, the ladies whisper'd, and\n  The empress smiled: the reigning favourite frown'd—\nI quite forget which of them was in hand\n  Just then; as they are rather numerous found,\nWho took by turns that difficult command\n  Since first her majesty was singly crown'd:\nBut they were mostly nervous six-foot fellows,\nAll fit to make a Patagonian jealous.\n\nJuan was none of these, but slight and slim,\n  Blushing and beardless; and yet ne'ertheless\nThere was a something in his turn of limb,\n  And still more in his eye, which seem'd to express,\nThat though he look'd one of the seraphim,\n  There lurk'd a man beneath the spirit's dress.\nBesides, the empress sometimes liked a boy,\nAnd had just buried the fair-faced Lanskoi.\n\nNo wonder then that Yermoloff, or Momonoff,\n  Or Scherbatoff, or any other off\nOr on, might dread her majesty had not room enough\n  Within her bosom (which was not too tough)\nFor a new flame; a thought to cast of gloom enough\n  Along the aspect, whether smooth or rough,\nOf him who, in the language of his station,\nThen held that 'high official situation.'\n\nO, gentle ladies! should you seek to know\n  The import of this diplomatic phrase,\nBid Ireland's Londonderry's Marquess show\n  His parts of speech; and in the strange displays\nOf that odd string of words, all in a row,\n  Which none divine, and every one obeys,\nPerhaps you may pick out some queer no meaning,\nOf that weak wordy harvest the sole gleaning.\n\nI think I can explain myself without\n  That sad inexplicable beast of prey—\nThat Sphinx, whose words would ever be a doubt,\n  Did not his deeds unriddle them each day—\nThat monstrous hieroglyphic—that long spout\n  Of blood and water, leaden Castlereagh!\nAnd here I must an anecdote relate,\nBut luckily of no great length or weight.\n\nAn English lady ask'd of an Italian,\n  What were the actual and official duties\nOf the strange thing some women set a value on,\n  Which hovers oft about some married beauties,\nCalled 'Cavalier servente?'—a Pygmalion\n  Whose statues warm (I fear, alas! too true 't is)\nBeneath his art. The dame, press'd to disclose them,\nSaid—'Lady, I beseech you to suppose them.'\n\nAnd thus I supplicate your supposition,\n  And mildest, matron-like interpretation,\nOf the imperial favourite's condition.\n  'T was a high place, the highest in the nation\nIn fact, if not in rank; and the suspicion\n  Of any one's attaining to his station,\nNo doubt gave pain, where each new pair of shoulders,\nIf rather broad, made stocks rise and their holders.\n\nJuan, I said, was a most beauteous boy,\n  And had retain'd his boyish look beyond\nThe usual hirsute seasons which destroy,\n  With beards and whiskers, and the like, the fond\nParisian aspect which upset old Troy\n  And founded Doctors' Commons:—I have conn'd\nThe history of divorces, which, though chequer'd,\nCalls Ilion's the first damages on record.\n\nAnd Catherine, who loved all things (save her lord,\n  Who was gone to his place), and pass'd for much\nAdmiring those (by dainty dames abhorr'd)\n  Gigantic gentlemen, yet had a touch\nOf sentiment; and he she most adored\n  Was the lamented Lanskoi, who was such\nA lover as had cost her many a tear,\nAnd yet but made a middling grenadier.\n\nO thou 'teterrima causa' of all 'belli'-\n  Thou gate of life and death—thou nondescript!\nWhence is our exit and our entrance,—well I\n  May pause in pondering how all souls are dipt\nIn thy perennial fountain:—how man fell I\n  Know not, since knowledge saw her branches stript\nOf her first fruit; but how he falls and rises\nSince, thou hast settled beyond all surmises.\n\nSome call thee 'the worst cause of war,' but I\n  Maintain thou art the best: for after all\nFrom thee we come, to thee we go, and why\n  To get at thee not batter down a wall,\nOr waste a world? since no one can deny\n  Thou dost replenish worlds both great and small:\nWith, or without thee, all things at a stand\nAre, or would be, thou sea of life's dry land!\n\nCatherine, who was the grand epitome\n  Of that great cause of war, or peace, or what\nYou please (it causes all the things which be,\n  So you may take your choice of this or that)—\nCatherine, I say, was very glad to see\n  The handsome herald, on whose plumage sat\nVictory; and pausing as she saw him kneel\nWith his despatch, forgot to break the seal.\n\nThen recollecting the whole empress, nor\n  forgetting quite the woman (which composed\nAt least three parts of this great whole), she tore\n  The letter open with an air which posed\nThe court, that watch'd each look her visage wore,\n  Until a royal smile at length disclosed\nFair weather for the day. Though rather spacious,\nHer face was noble, her eyes fine, mouth gracious.\n\nGreat joy was hers, or rather joys: the first\n  Was a ta'en city, thirty thousand slain.\nGlory and triumph o'er her aspect burst,\n  As an East Indian sunrise on the main.\nThese quench'd a moment her ambition's thirst—\n  So Arab deserts drink in summer's rain:\nIn vain!—As fall the dews on quenchless sands,\nBlood only serves to wash Ambition's hands!\n\nHer next amusement was more fanciful;\n  She smiled at mad Suwarrow's rhymes, who threw\nInto a Russian couplet rather dull\n  The whole gazette of thousands whom he slew.\nHer third was feminine enough to annul\n  The shudder which runs naturally through\nOur veins, when things call'd sovereigns think it best\nTo kill, and generals turn it into jest.\n\nThe two first feelings ran their course complete,\n  And lighted first her eye, and then her mouth:\nThe whole court look'd immediately most sweet,\n  Like flowers well water'd after a long drouth.\nBut when on the lieutenant at her feet\n  Her majesty, who liked to gaze on youth\nAlmost as much as on a new despatch,\nGlanced mildly, all the world was on the watch.\n\nThough somewhat large, exuberant, and truculent,\n  When wroth—while pleased, she was as fine a figure\nAs those who like things rosy, ripe, and succulent,\n  Would wish to look on, while they are in vigour.\nShe could repay each amatory look you lent\n  With interest, and in turn was wont with rigour\nTo exact of Cupid's bills the full amount\nAt sight, nor would permit you to discount.\n\nWith her the latter, though at times convenient,\n  Was not so necessary; for they tell\nThat she was handsome, and though fierce look'd lenient,\n  And always used her favourites too well.\nIf once beyond her boudoir's precincts in ye went,\n  Your 'fortune' was in a fair way 'to swell\nA man' (as Giles says); for though she would widow all\nNations, she liked man as an individual.\n\nWhat a strange thing is man? and what a stranger\n  Is woman! What a whirlwind is her head,\nAnd what a whirlpool full of depth and danger\n  Is all the rest about her! Whether wed\nOr widow, maid or mother, she can change her\n  Mind like the wind: whatever she has said\nOr done, is light to what she 'll say or do;—\nThe oldest thing on record, and yet new!\n\nO Catherine! (for of all interjections,\n  To thee both oh! and ah! belong of right\nIn love and war) how odd are the connections\n  Of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight!\nJust now yours were cut out in different sections:\n  First Ismail's capture caught your fancy quite;\nNext of new knights, the fresh and glorious batch;\nAnd thirdly he who brought you the despatch!\n\nShakspeare talks of 'the herald Mercury\n  New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;'\nAnd some such visions cross'd her majesty,\n  While her young herald knelt before her still.\n'T is very true the hill seem'd rather high,\n  For a lieutenant to climb up; but skill\nSmooth'd even the Simplon's steep, and by God's blessing\nWith youth and health all kisses are 'heaven-kissing.'\n\nHer majesty look'd down, the youth look'd up—\n  And so they fell in love;—she with his face,\nHis grace, his God-knows-what: for Cupid's cup\n  With the first draught intoxicates apace,\nA quintessential laudanum or 'black drop,'\n  Which makes one drunk at once, without the base\nExpedient of full bumpers; for the eye\nIn love drinks all life's fountains (save tears) dry.\n\nHe, on the other hand, if not in love,\n  Fell into that no less imperious passion,\nSelf-love—which, when some sort of thing above\n  Ourselves, a singer, dancer, much in fashion,\nOr duchess, princess, empress, 'deigns to prove'\n  ('T is Pope's phrase) a great longing, though a rash one,\nFor one especial person out of many,\nMakes us believe ourselves as good as any.\n\nBesides, he was of that delighted age\n  Which makes all female ages equal—when\nWe don't much care with whom we may engage,\n  As bold as Daniel in the lion's den,\nSo that we can our native sun assuage\n  In the next ocean, which may flow just then,\nTo make a twilight in, just as Sol's heat is\nQuench'd in the lap of the salt sea, or Thetis.\n\nAnd Catherine (we must say thus much for Catherine),\n  Though bold and bloody, was the kind of thing\nWhose temporary passion was quite flattering,\n  Because each lover look'd a sort of king,\nMade up upon an amatory pattern,\n  A royal husband in all save the ring—\nWhich, being the damn'dest part of matrimony,\nSeem'd taking out the sting to leave the honey.\n\nAnd when you add to this, her womanhood\n  In its meridian, her blue eyes or gray\n(The last, if they have soul, are quite as good,\n  Or better, as the best examples say:\nNapoleon's, Mary's (queen of Scotland), should\n  Lend to that colour a transcendent ray;\nAnd Pallas also sanctions the same hue,\nToo wise to look through optics black or blue)—\n\nHer sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,\n  Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,\nHer preference of a boy to men much bigger\n  (Fellows whom Messalina's self would pension),\nHer prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,\n  With other extras, which we need not mention,—\nAll these, or any one of these, explain\nEnough to make a stripling very vain.\n\nAnd that 's enough, for love is vanity,\n  Selfish in its beginning as its end,\nExcept where 't is a mere insanity,\n  A maddening spirit which would strive to blend\nItself with beauty's frail inanity,\n  On which the passion's self seems to depend:\nAnd hence some heathenish philosophers\nMake love the main spring of the universe.\n\nBesides Platonic love, besides the love\n  Of God, the love of sentiment, the loving\nOf faithful pairs (I needs must rhyme with dove,\n  That good old steam-boat which keeps verses moving\n'Gainst reason—Reason ne'er was hand-and-glove\n  With rhyme, but always leant less to improving\nThe sound than sense)—beside all these pretences\nTo love, there are those things which words name senses;\n\nThose movements, those improvements in our bodies\n  Which make all bodies anxious to get out\nOf their own sand-pits, to mix with a goddess,\n  For such all women are at first no doubt.\nHow beautiful that moment! and how odd is\n  That fever which precedes the languid rout\nOf our sensations! What a curious way\nThe whole thing is of clothing souls in clay!\n\nThe noblest kind of love is love Platonical,\n  To end or to begin with; the next grand\nIs that which may be christen'd love canonical,\n  Because the clergy take the thing in hand;\nThe third sort to be noted in our chronicle\n  As flourishing in every Christian land,\nIs when chaste matrons to their other ties\nAdd what may be call'd marriage in disguise.\n\nWell, we won't analyse—our story must\n  Tell for itself: the sovereign was smitten,\nJuan much flatter'd by her love, or lust;—\n  I cannot stop to alter words once written,\nAnd the two are so mix'd with human dust,\n  That he who names one, both perchance may hit on:\nBut in such matters Russia's mighty empress\nBehaved no better than a common sempstress.\n\nThe whole court melted into one wide whisper,\n  And all lips were applied unto all ears!\nThe elder ladies' wrinkles curl'd much crisper\n  As they beheld; the younger cast some leers\nOn one another, and each lovely lisper\n  Smiled as she talk'd the matter o'er; but tears\nOf rivalship rose in each clouded eye\nOf all the standing army who stood by.\n\nAll the ambassadors of all the powers\n  Enquired, Who was this very new young man,\nWho promised to be great in some few hours?\n  Which is full soon—though life is but a span.\nAlready they beheld the silver showers\n  Of rubles rain, as fast as specie can,\nUpon his cabinet, besides the presents\nOf several ribands, and some thousand peasants.\n\nCatherine was generous,—all such ladies are:\n  Love, that great opener of the heart and all\nThe ways that lead there, be they near or far,\n  Above, below, by turnpikes great or small,—\nLove (though she had a cursed taste for war,\n  And was not the best wife, unless we call\nSuch Clytemnestra, though perhaps 't is better\nThat one should die, than two drag on the fetter)—\n\nLove had made Catherine make each lover's fortune,\n  Unlike our own half-chaste Elizabeth,\nWhose avarice all disbursements did importune,\n  If history, the grand liar, ever saith\nThe truth; and though grief her old age might shorten,\n  Because she put a favourite to death,\nHer vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,\nAnd stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.\n\nBut when the levee rose, and all was bustle\n  In the dissolving circle, all the nations'\nAmbassadors began as 't were to hustle\n  Round the young man with their congratulations.\nAlso the softer silks were heard to rustle\n  Of gentle dames, among whose recreations\nIt is to speculate on handsome faces,\nEspecially when such lead to high places.\n\nJuan, who found himself, he knew not how,\n  A general object of attention, made\nHis answers with a very graceful bow,\n  As if born for the ministerial trade.\nThough modest, on his unembarrass'd brow\n  Nature had written 'gentleman.' He said\nLittle, but to the purpose; and his manner\nFlung hovering graces o'er him like a banner.\n\nAn order from her majesty consign'd\n  Our young lieutenant to the genial care\nOf those in office: all the world look'd kind\n  (As it will look sometimes with the first stare,\nWhich youth would not act ill to keep in mind),\n  As also did Miss Protasoff then there,\nNamed from her mystic office 'l'Eprouveuse,'\nA term inexplicable to the Muse.\n\nWith her then, as in humble duty bound,\n  Juan retired,—and so will I, until\nMy Pegasus shall tire of touching ground.\n  We have just lit on a 'heaven-kissing hill,'\nSo lofty that I feel my brain turn round,\n  And all my fancies whirling like a mill;\nWhich is a signal to my nerves and brain,\nTo take a quiet ride in some green Lane.</code>"

You 'd think\n  Grief a rich field which never would lie fallow;\nNo more it doth, its ploughs but change their boys,\nWho furrow some new soil to sow for joys.\n\nBut coughs will come when sighs depart—and now\n  And then before sighs cease; for oft the one\nWill bring the other, ere the lake-like brow\n  Is ruffled by a wrinkle, or the sun\nOf life reach'd ten o'clock: and while a glow,\n  Hectic and brief as summer's day nigh done,\nO'erspreads the cheek which seems too pure for clay,\nThousands blaze, love, hope, die,—how happy they!\n\nBut Juan was not meant to die so soon.\n  We left him in the focus of such glory\nAs may be won by favour of the moon\n  Or ladies' fancies—rather transitory\nPerhaps; but who would scorn the month of June,\n  Because December, with his breath so hoary,\nMust come? Much rather should he court the ray,\nTo hoard up warmth against a wintry day.\n\nBesides, he had some qualities which fix\n  Middle-aged ladies even more than young:\nThe former know what 's what; while new-fledged chicks\n  Know little more of love than what is sung\nIn rhymes, or dreamt (for fancy will play tricks)\n  In visions of those skies from whence Love sprung.\nSome reckon women by their suns or years,\nI rather think the moon should date the dears.\n\nAnd why? because she 's changeable and chaste.\n  I know no other reason, whatsoe'er\nSuspicious people, who find fault in haste,\n  May choose to tax me with; which is not fair,\nNor flattering to 'their temper or their taste,'\n  As my friend Jeffrey writes with such an air:\nHowever, I forgive him, and I trust\nHe will forgive himself;—if not, I must.\n\nOld enemies who have become new friends\n  Should so continue—'t is a point of honour;\nAnd I know nothing which could make amends\n  For a return to hatred: I would shun her\nLike garlic, howsoever she extends\n  Her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.\nOld flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes—\nConverted foes should scorn to join with those.\n\nThis were the worst desertion:—renegadoes,\n  Even shuffling Southey, that incarnate lie,\nWould scarcely join again the 'reformadoes,'\n  Whom he forsook to fill the laureate's sty:\nAnd honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,\n  Whether in Caledon or Italy,\nShould not veer round with every breath, nor seize\nTo pain, the moment when you cease to please.\n\nThe lawyer and the critic but behold\n  The baser sides of literature and life,\nAnd nought remains unseen, but much untold,\n  By those who scour those double vales of strife.\nWhile common men grow ignorantly old,\n  The lawyer's brief is like the surgeon's knife,\nDissecting the whole inside of a question,\nAnd with it all the process of digestion.\n\nA legal broom 's a moral chimney-sweeper,\n  And that 's the reason he himself 's so dirty;\nThe endless soot bestows a tint far deeper\n  Than can be hid by altering his shirt; he\nRetains the sable stains of the dark creeper,\n  At least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,\nIn all their habits;—not so you, I own;\nAs Caesar wore his robe you wear your gown.\n\nAnd all our little feuds, at least all mine,\n  Dear Jefferson, once my most redoubted foe\n(As far as rhyme and criticism combine\n  To make such puppets of us things below),\nAre over: Here 's a health to 'Auld Lang Syne!'\n  I do not know you, and may never know\nYour face—but you have acted on the whole\nMost nobly, and I own it from my soul.\n\nAnd when I use the phrase of 'Auld Lang Syne!'\n  'T is not address'd to you—the more 's the pity\nFor me, for I would rather take my wine\n  With you, than aught (save Scott) in your proud city.\nBut somehow,—it may seem a schoolboy's whine,\n  And yet I seek not to be grand nor witty,\nBut I am half a Scot by birth, and bred\nA whole one, and my heart flies to my head,—\n\nAs 'Auld Lang Syne' brings Scotland, one and all,\n  Scotch plaids, Scotch snoods, the blue hills, and clear streams,\nThe Dee, the Don, Balgounie's brig's black wall,\n  All my boy feelings, all my gentler dreams\nOf what I then dreamt, clothed in their own pall,\n  Like Banquo's offspring;—floating past me seems\nMy childhood in this childishness of mine:\nI care not—'t is a glimpse of 'Auld Lang Syne.'\n\nAnd though, as you remember, in a fit\n  Of wrath and rhyme, when juvenile and curly,\nI rail'd at Scots to show my wrath and wit,\n  Which must be own'd was sensitive and surly,\nYet 't is in vain such sallies to permit,\n  They cannot quench young feelings fresh and early:\nI 'scotch'd not kill'd' the Scotchman in my blood,\nAnd love the land of 'mountain and of flood.'\n\nDon Juan, who was real, or ideal,—\n  For both are much the same, since what men think\nExists when the once thinkers are less real\n  Than what they thought, for mind can never sink,\nAnd 'gainst the body makes a strong appeal;\n  And yet 't is very puzzling on the brink\nOf what is call'd eternity, to stare,\nAnd know no more of what is here, than there;—\n\nDon Juan grew a very polish'd Russian—\n  How we won't mention, why we need not say:\nFew youthful minds can stand the strong concussion\n  Of any slight temptation in their way;\nBut his just now were spread as is a cushion\n  Smooth'd for a monarch's seat of honour; gay\nDamsels, and dances, revels, ready money,\nMade ice seem paradise, and winter sunny.\n\nThe favour of the empress was agreeable;\n  And though the duty wax'd a little hard,\nYoung people at his time of life should be able\n  To come off handsomely in that regard.\nHe was now growing up like a green tree, able\n  For love, war, or ambition, which reward\nTheir luckier votaries, till old age's tedium\nMake some prefer the circulating medium.\n\nAbout this time, as might have been anticipated,\n  Seduced by youth and dangerous examples,\nDon Juan grew, I fear, a little dissipated;\n  Which is a sad thing, and not only tramples\nOn our fresh feelings, but—as being participated\n  With all kinds of incorrigible samples\nOf frail humanity—must make us selfish,\nAnd shut our souls up in us like a shell-fish.\n\nThis we pass over. We will also pass\n  The usual progress of intrigues between\nUnequal matches, such as are, alas!\n  A young lieutenant's with a not old queen,\nBut one who is not so youthful as she was\n  In all the royalty of sweet seventeen.\nSovereigns may sway materials, but not matter,\n\nAnd Death, the sovereign's sovereign, though the great\n  Gracchus of all mortality, who levels\nWith his Agrarian laws the high estate\n  Of him who feasts, and fights, and roars, and revels,\nTo one small grass-grown patch (which must await\n  Corruption for its crop) with the poor devils\nWho never had a foot of land till now,—\nDeath 's a reformer, all men must allow.\n\nHe lived (not Death, but Juan) in a hurry\n  Of waste, and haste, and glare, and gloss, and glitter,\nIn this gay clime of bear-skins black and furry—\n  Which (though I hate to say a thing that 's bitter)\nPeep out sometimes, when things are in a flurry,\n  Through all the 'purple and fine linen,' fitter\nFor Babylon's than Russia's royal harlot—\nAnd neutralize her outward show of scarlet.\n\nAnd this same state we won't describe: we would\n  Perhaps from hearsay, or from recollection;\nBut getting nigh grim Dante's 'obscure wood,'\n  That horrid equinox, that hateful section\nOf human years, that half-way house, that rude\n  Hut, whence wise travellers drive with circumspection\nLife's sad post-horses o'er the dreary frontier\nOf age, and looking back to youth, give one tear;—\n\nI won't describe,—that is, if I can help\n  Description; and I won't reflect,—that is,\nIf I can stave off thought, which—as a whelp\n  Clings to its teat—sticks to me through the abyss\nOf this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp\n  Holds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss\nDrains its first draught of lips:—but, as I said,\nI won't philosophise, and will be read.\n\nJuan, instead of courting courts, was courted,—\n  A thing which happens rarely: this he owed\nMuch to his youth, and much to his reported\n  Valour; much also to the blood he show'd,\nLike a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,\n  Which set the beauty off in which he glow'd,\nAs purple clouds befringe the sun; but most\nHe owed to an old woman and his post.\n\nHe wrote to Spain:—and all his near relations,\n  Perceiving fie was in a handsome way\nOf getting on himself, and finding stations\n  For cousins also, answer'd the same day.\nSeveral prepared themselves for emigrations;\n  And eating ices, were o'erheard to say,\nThat with the addition of a slight pelisse,\nMadrid's and Moscow's climes were of a piece.\n\nHis mother, Donna Inez, finding, too,\n  That in the lieu of drawing on his banker,\nWhere his assets were waxing rather few,\n  He had brought his spending to a handsome anchor,—\nReplied, 'that she was glad to see him through\n  Those pleasures after which wild youth will hanker;\nAs the sole sign of man's being in his senses\nIs, learning to reduce his past expenses.\n\n'She also recommended him to God,\n  And no less to God's Son, as well as Mother,\nWarn'd him against Greek worship, which looks odd\n  In Catholic eyes; but told him, too, to smother\nOutward dislike, which don't look well abroad;\n  Inform'd him that he had a little brother\nBorn in a second wedlock; and above\nAll, praised the empress's maternal love.\n\n'She could not too much give her approbation\n  Unto an empress, who preferr'd young men\nWhose age, and what was better still, whose nation\n  And climate, stopp'd all scandal (now and then):—\nAt home it might have given her some vexation;\n  But where thermometers sunk down to ten,\nOr five, or one, or zero, she could never\nBelieve that virtue thaw'd before the river.'\n\nO for a forty-parson power to chant\n  Thy praise, Hypocrisy! Oh for a hymn\nLoud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt,\n  Not practise! Oh for trumps of cherubim!\nOr the ear-trumpet of my good old aunt,\n  Who, though her spectacles at last grew dim,\nDrew quiet consolation through its hint,\nWhen she no more could read the pious print.\n\nShe was no hypocrite at least, poor soul,\n  But went to heaven in as sincere a way\nAs any body on the elected roll,\n  Which portions out upon the judgment day\nHeaven's freeholds, in a sort of doomsday scroll,\n  Such as the conqueror William did repay\nHis knights with, lotting others' properties\nInto some sixty thousand new knights' fees.\n\nI can't complain, whose ancestors are there,\n  Erneis, Radulphus—eight-and-forty manors\n(If that my memory doth not greatly err)\n  Were their reward for following Billy's banners:\nAnd though I can't help thinking 't was scarce fair\n  To strip the Saxons of their hydes, like tanners;\nYet as they founded churches with the produce,\nYou 'll deem, no doubt, they put it to a good use.\n\nThe gentle Juan flourish'd, though at times\n  He felt like other plants called sensitive,\nWhich shrink from touch, as monarchs do from rhymes,\n  Save such as Southey can afford to give.\nPerhaps he long'd in bitter frosts for climes\n  In which the Neva's ice would cease to live\nBefore May-day: perhaps, despite his duty,\nIn royalty's vast arms he sigh d for beauty:\n\nPerhaps—but, sans perhaps, we need not seek\n  For causes young or old: the canker-worm\nWill feed upon the fairest, freshest cheek,\n  As well as further drain the wither'd form:\nCare, like a housekeeper, brings every week\n  His bills in, and however we may storm,\nThey must be paid: though six days smoothly run,\nThe seventh will bring blue devils or a dun.\n\nI don't know how it was, but he grew sick:\n  The empress was alarm'd, and her physician\n(The same who physick'd Peter) found the tick\n  Of his fierce pulse betoken a condition\nWhich augur'd of the dead, however quick\n  Itself, and show'd a feverish disposition;\nAt which the whole court was extremely troubled,\nThe sovereign shock'd, and all his medicines doubled.\n\nLow were the whispers, manifold the rumours:\n  Some said he had been poison'd by Potemkin;\nOthers talk'd learnedly of certain tumours,\n  Exhaustion, or disorders of the same kin;\nSome said 't was a concoction of the humours,\n  Which with the blood too readily will claim kin;\nOthers again were ready to maintain,\n''T was only the fatigue of last campaign.'\n\nBut here is one prescription out of many:\n  'Sodae sulphat. 3vj. 3fs. Mannae optim.\nAq. fervent. f. 3ifs. 3ij. tinct. Sennae\n  Haustus' (And here the surgeon came and cupp'd him)\n'Rx Pulv Com gr. iij. Ipecacuanhae'\n  (With more beside if Juan had not stopp'd 'em).\n'Bolus Potassae Sulphuret. sumendus,\nEt haustus ter in die capiendus.'\n\nThis is the way physicians mend or end us,\n  Secundum artem: but although we sneer\nIn health—when ill, we call them to attend us,\n  Without the least propensity to jeer:\nWhile that 'hiatus maxime deflendus'\n  To be fill'd up by spade or mattock's near,\nInstead of gliding graciously down Lethe,\nWe tease mild Baillie, or soft Abernethy.\n\nJuan demurr'd at this first notice to\n  Quit; and though death had threaten'd an ejection,\nHis youth and constitution bore him through,\n  And sent the doctors in a new direction.\nBut still his state was delicate: the hue\n  Of health but flicker'd with a faint reflection\nAlong his wasted cheek, and seem'd to gravel\nThe faculty—who said that he must travel.\n\nThe climate was too cold, they said, for him,\n  Meridian-born, to bloom in. This opinion\nMade the chaste Catherine look a little grim,\n  Who did not like at first to lose her minion:\nBut when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim,\n  And drooping like an eagle's with clipt pinion,\nShe then resolved to send him on a mission,\nBut in a style becoming his condition.\n\nThere was just then a kind of a discussion,\n  A sort of treaty or negotiation\nBetween the British cabinet and Russian,\n  Maintain'd with all the due prevarication\nWith which great states such things are apt to push on;\n  Something about the Baltic's navigation,\nHides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of Thetis,\nWhich Britons deem their 'uti possidetis.'\n\nSo Catherine, who had a handsome way\n  Of fitting out her favourites, conferr'd\nThis secret charge on Juan, to display\n  At once her royal splendour, and reward\nHis services. He kiss'd hands the next day,\n  Received instructions how to play his card,\nWas laden with all kinds of gifts and honours,\nWhich show'd what great discernment was the donor's.\n\nBut she was lucky, and luck 's all. Your queens\n  Are generally prosperous in reigning;\nWhich puzzles us to know what Fortune means.\n  But to continue: though her years were waning\nHer climacteric teased her like her teens;\n  And though her dignity brook'd no complaining,\nSo much did Juan's setting off distress her,\nShe could not find at first a fit successor.\n\nBut time, the comforter, will come at last;\n  And four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number\nOf candidates requesting to be placed,\n  Made Catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:—\nNot that she meant to fix again in haste,\n  Nor did she find the quantity encumber,\nBut always choosing with deliberation,\nKept the place open for their emulation.\n\nWhile this high post of honour 's in abeyance,\n  For one or two days, reader, we request\nYou 'll mount with our young hero the conveyance\n  Which wafted him from Petersburgh: the best\nBarouche, which had the glory to display once\n  The fair czarina's autocratic crest,\nWhen, a new lphigene, she went to Tauris,\nWas given to her favourite, and now bore his.\n\nA bull-dog, and a bullfinch, and an ermine,\n  All private favourites of Don Juan;—for\n(Let deeper sages the true cause determine)\n  He had a kind of inclination, or\nWeakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,\n  Live animals: an old maid of threescore\nFor cats and birds more penchant ne'er display'd,\nAlthough he was not old, nor even a maid;—\n\nThe animals aforesaid occupied\n  Their station: there were valets, secretaries,\nIn other vehicles; but at his side\n  Sat little Leila, who survived the parries\nHe made 'gainst Cossacque sabres, in the wide\n  Slaughter of Ismail. Though my wild Muse varies\nHer note, she don't forget the infant girl\nWhom he preserved, a pure and living pearl\n\nPoor little thing! She was as fair as docile,\n  And with that gentle, serious character,\nAs rare in living beings as a fossile\n  Man, 'midst thy mouldy mammoths, 'grand Cuvier!'\nIll fitted was her ignorance to jostle\n  With this o'erwhelming world, where all must err:\nBut she was yet but ten years old, and therefore\nWas tranquil, though she knew not why or wherefore.\n\nDon Juan loved her, and she loved him, as\n  Nor brother, father, sister, daughter love.\nI cannot tell exactly what it was;\n  He was not yet quite old enough to prove\nParental feelings, and the other class,\n  Call'd brotherly affection, could not move\nHis bosom,—for he never had a sister:\nAh! if he had, how much he would have miss'd her!\n\nAnd still less was it sensual; for besides\n  That he was not an ancient debauchee\n(Who like sour fruit, to stir their veins' salt tides,\n  As acids rouse a dormant alkali),\nAlthough ('t will happen as our planet guides)\n  His youth was not the chastest that might be,\nThere was the purest Platonism at bottom\nOf all his feelings—only he forgot 'em.\n\nJust now there was no peril of temptation;\n  He loved the infant orphan he had saved,\nAs patriots (now and then) may love a nation;\n  His pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved\nOwing to him;—as also her salvation\n  Through his means and the church's might be paved.\nBut one thing 's odd, which here must be inserted,\nThe little Turk refused to be converted.\n\n'T was strange enough she should retain the impression\n  Through such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;\nBut though three bishops told her the transgression,\n  She show'd a great dislike to holy water:\nShe also had no passion for confession;\n  Perhaps she had nothing to confess:—no matter,\nWhate'er the cause, the church made little of it—\nShe still held out that Mahomet was a prophet.\n\nIn fact, the only Christian she could bear\n  Was Juan; whom she seem'd to have selected\nIn place of what her home and friends once were.\n  He naturally loved what he protected:\nAnd thus they form'd a rather curious pair,\n  A guardian green in years, a ward connected\nIn neither clime, time, blood, with her defender;\nAnd yet this want of ties made theirs more tender.\n\nThey journey'd on through Poland and through Warsaw,\n  Famous for mines of salt and yokes of iron:\nThrough Courland also, which that famous farce saw\n  Which gave her dukes the graceless name of 'Biron.'\n'T is the same landscape which the modern Mars saw,\n  Who march'd to Moscow, led by Fame, the siren!\nTo lose by one month's frost some twenty years\nOf conquest, and his guard of grenadiers.\n\nLet this not seem an anti-climax:—'Oh!\n  My guard! my old guard exclaim'd!' exclaim'd that god of day.\nThink of the Thunderer's falling down below\n  Carotid-artery-cutting Castlereagh!\nAlas, that glory should be chill'd by snow!\n  But should we wish to warm us on our way\nThrough Poland, there is Kosciusko's name\nMight scatter fire through ice, like Hecla's flame.\n\nFrom Poland they came on through Prussia Proper,\n  And Konigsberg the capital, whose vaunt,\nBesides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,\n  Has lately been the great Professor Kant.\nJuan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper\n  About philosophy, pursued his jaunt\nTo Germany, whose somewhat tardy millions\nHave princes who spur more than their postilions.\n\nAnd thence through Berlin, Dresden, and the like,\n  Until he reach'd the castellated Rhine:—\nYe glorious Gothic scenes! how much ye strike\n  All phantasies, not even excepting mine;\nA grey wall, a green ruin, rusty pike,\n  Make my soul pass the equinoctial line\nBetween the present and past worlds, and hover\nUpon their airy confine, half-seas-over.\n\nBut Juan posted on through Manheim, Bonn,\n  Which Drachenfels frowns over like a spectre\nOf the good feudal times forever gone,\n  On which I have not time just now to lecture.\nFrom thence he was drawn onwards to Cologne,\n  A city which presents to the inspector\nEleven thousand maidenheads of bone,\nThe greatest number flesh hath ever known.\n\nFrom thence to Holland's Hague and Helvoetsluys,\n  That water-land of Dutchmen and of ditches,\nWhere juniper expresses its best juice,\n  The poor man's sparkling substitute for riches.\nSenates and sages have condemn'd its use—\n  But to deny the mob a cordial, which is\nToo often all the clothing, meat, or fuel,\nGood government has left them, seems but cruel.\n\nHere he embark'd, and with a flowing sail\n  Went bounding for the island of the free,\nTowards which the impatient wind blew half a gale;\n  High dash'd the spray, the bows dipp'd in the sea,\nAnd sea-sick passengers turn'd somewhat pale;\n  But Juan, season'd, as he well might be,\nBy former voyages, stood to watch the skiffs\nWhich pass'd, or catch the first glimpse of the cliffs.\n\nAt length they rose, like a white wall along\n  The blue sea's border; and I Don Juan felt—\nWhat even young strangers feel a little strong\n  At the first sight of Albion's chalky belt—\nA kind of pride that he should be among\n  Those haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt\nTheir goods and edicts out from pole to pole,\nAnd made the very billows pay them toll.\n\nI 've no great cause to love that spot of earth,\n  Which holds what might have been the noblest nation;\nBut though I owe it little but my birth,\n  I feel a mix'd regret and veneration\nFor its decaying fame and former worth.\n  Seven years (the usual term of transportation)\nOf absence lay one's old resentments level,\nWhen a man's country 's going to the devil.\n\nAlas! could she but fully, truly, know\n  How her great name is now throughout abhorr'd:\nHow eager all the earth is for the blow\n  Which shall lay bare her bosom to the sword;\nHow all the nations deem her their worst foe,\n  That worse than worst of foes, the once adored\nFalse friend, who held out freedom to mankind,\nAnd now would chain them, to the very mind:—\n\nWould she be proud, or boast herself the free,\n  Who is but first of slaves? The nations are\nIn prison,—but the gaoler, what is he?\n  No less a victim to the bolt and bar.\nIs the poor privilege to turn the key\n  Upon the captive, freedom? He 's as far\nFrom the enjoyment of the earth and air\nWho watches o'er the chain, as they who wear.\n\nDon Juan now saw Albion's earliest beauties,\n  Thy cliffs, dear Dover! harbour, and hotel;\nThy custom-house, with all its delicate duties;\n  Thy waiters running mucks at every bell;\nThy packets, all whose passengers are booties\n  To those who upon land or water dwell;\nAnd last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,\nThy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted.\n\nJuan, though careless, young, and magnifique,\n  And rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,\nWho did not limit much his bills per week,\n  Yet stared at this a little, though he paid it\n(His Maggior Duomo, a smart, subtle Greek,\n  Before him summ'd the awful scroll and read it);\nBut doubtless as the air, though seldom sunny,\nIs free, the respiration's worth the money.\n\nOn with the horses! Off to Canterbury!\n  Tramp, tramp o'er pebble, and splash, splash through puddle;\nHurrah! how swiftly speeds the post so merry!\n  Not like slow Germany, wherein they muddle\nAlong the road, as if they went to bury\n  Their fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle\nWith 'schnapps'—sad dogs! whom 'Hundsfot,' or 'Verflucter,'\nAffect no more than lightning a conductor.\n\nNow there is nothing gives a man such spirits,\n  Leavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry,\nAs going at full speed—no matter where its\n  Direction be, so 't is but in a hurry,\nAnd merely for the sake of its own merits;\n  For the less cause there is for all this flurry,\nThe greater is the pleasure in arriving\nAt the great end of travel—which is driving.\n\nThey saw at Canterbury the cathedral;\n  Black Edward's helm, and Becket's bloody stone,\nWere pointed out as usual by the bedral,\n  In the same quaint, uninterested tone:—\nThere 's glory again for you, gentle reader! All\n  Ends in a rusty casque and dubious bone,\nHalf-solved into these sodas or magnesias;\nWhich form that bitter draught, the human species.\n\nThe effect on Juan was of course sublime:\n  He breathed a thousand Cressys, as he saw\nThat casque, which never stoop'd except to Time.\n  Even the bold Churchman's tomb excited awe,\nWho died in the then great attempt to climb\n  O'er kings, who now at least must talk of law\nBefore they butcher. Little Leila gazed,\nAnd ask'd why such a structure had been raised:\n\nAnd being told it was 'God's house,' she said\n  He was well lodged, but only wonder'd how\nHe suffer'd Infidels in his homestead,\n  The cruel Nazarenes, who had laid low\nHis holy temples in the lands which bred\n  The True Believers:—and her infant brow\nWas bent with grief that Mahomet should resign\nA mosque so noble, flung like pearls to swine.\n\nO! oh! through meadows managed like a garden,\n  A paradise of hops and high production;\nFor after years of travel by a bard in\n  Countries of greater heat, but lesser suction,\nA green field is a sight which makes him pardon\n  The absence of that more sublime construction,\nWhich mixes up vines, olives, precipices,\nGlaciers, volcanos, oranges, and ices.\n\nAnd when I think upon a pot of beer—\n  But I won't weep!—and so drive on, postilions!\nAs the smart boys spurr'd fast in their career,\n  Juan admired these highways of free millions;\nA country in all senses the most dear\n  To foreigner or native, save some silly ones,\nWho 'kick against the pricks' just at this juncture,\nAnd for their pains get only a fresh puncture.\n\nWhat a delightful thing 's a turnpike road!\n  So smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving\nThe earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad\n  Air can accomplish, with his wide wings waving.\nHad such been cut in Phaeton's time, the god\n  Had told his son to satisfy his craving\nWith the York mail;—but onward as we roll,\n'Surgit amari aliquid'—the toll\n\nAlas, how deeply painful is all payment!\n  Take lives, take wives, take aught except men's purses:\nAs Machiavel shows those in purple raiment,\n  Such is the shortest way to general curses.\nThey hate a murderer much less than a claimant\n  On that sweet ore which every body nurses;—\nKill a man's family, and he may brook it,\nBut keep your hands out of his breeches' pocket.\n\nSo said the Florentine: ye monarchs, hearken\n  To your instructor. Juan now was borne,\nJust as the day began to wane and darken,\n  O'er the high hill, which looks with pride or scorn\nToward the great city.—Ye who have a spark in\n  Your veins of Cockney spirit, smile or mourn\nAccording as you take things well or ill;—\nBold Britons, we are now on Shooter's Hill!\n\nThe sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from\n  A half-unquench'd volcano, o'er a space\nWhich well beseem'd the 'Devil's drawing-room,'\n  As some have qualified that wondrous place:\nBut Juan felt, though not approaching home,\n  As one who, though he were not of the race,\nRevered the soil, of those true sons the mother,\nWho butcher'd half the earth, and bullied t' other.\n\nA mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping,\n  Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye\nCould reach, with here and there a sail just skipping\n  In sight, then lost amidst the forestry\nOf masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping\n  On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;\nA huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown\nOn a fool's head—and there is London Town!\n\nBut Juan saw not this: each wreath of smoke\n  Appear'd to him but as the magic vapour\nOf some alchymic furnace, from whence broke\n  The wealth of worlds (a wealth of tax and paper):\nThe gloomy clouds, which o'er it as a yoke\n  Are bow'd, and put the sun out like a taper,\nWere nothing but the natural atmosphere,\nExtremely wholesome, though but rarely clear.\n\nHe paused—and so will I; as doth a crew\n  Before they give their broadside. By and by,\nMy gentle countrymen, we will renew\n  Our old acquaintance; and at least I 'll try\nTo tell you truths you will not take as true,\n  Because they are so;—a male Mrs. Fry,\nWith a soft besom will I sweep your halls,\nAnd brush a web or two from off the walls.\n\nO Mrs. Fry! Why go to Newgate? Why\n  Preach to poor rogues? And wherefore not begin\nWith Carlton, or with other houses? Try\n  Your head at harden'd and imperial sin.\nTo mend the people 's an absurdity,\n  A jargon, a mere philanthropic din,\nUnless you make their betters better:—Fy!\nI thought you had more religion, Mrs. Fry.\n\nTeach them the decencies of good threescore;\n  Cure them of tours, hussar and highland dresses;\nTell them that youth once gone returns no more,\n  That hired huzzas redeem no land's distresses;\nTell them Sir William Curtis is a bore,\n  Too dull even for the dullest of excesses,\nThe witless Falstaff of a hoary Hal,\nA fool whose bells have ceased to ring at all.\n\nTell them, though it may be perhaps too late,\n  On life's worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated,\nTo set up vain pretence of being great,\n  'T is not so to be good; and be it stated,\nThe worthiest kings have ever loved least state;\n  And tell them—But you won't, and I have prated\nJust now enough; but by and by I 'll prattle\nLike Roland's horn in Roncesvalles' battle.</code>"

I would shatter\n  Gladly all matters down to stone or lead,\nOr adamant, to find the world a spirit,\nAnd wear my head, denying that I wear it.\n\nWhat a sublime discovery 't was to make the\n  Universe universal egotism,\nThat all 's ideal—all ourselves: I 'll stake the\n  World (be it what you will) that that 's no schism.\nO Doubt!—if thou be'st Doubt, for which some take thee;\n  But which I doubt extremely—thou sole prism\nOf the Truth's rays, spoil not my draught of spirit!\nHeaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.\n\nFor ever and anon comes Indigestion,\n  (Not the most 'dainty Ariel') and perplexes\nOur soarings with another sort of question:\n  And that which after all my spirit vexes,\nIs, that I find no spot where man can rest eye on,\n  Without confusion of the sorts and sexes,\nOf beings, stars, and this unriddled wonder,\nThe world, which at the worst 's a glorious blunder—\n\nIf it be chance; or if it be according\n  To the old text, still better:—lest it should\nTurn out so, we 'll say nothing 'gainst the wording,\n  As several people think such hazards rude.\nThey 're right; our days are too brief for affording\n  Space to dispute what no one ever could\nDecide, and every body one day will\nKnow very clearly—or at least lie still.\n\nAnd therefore will I leave off metaphysical\n  Discussion, which is neither here nor there:\nIf I agree that what is, is; then this I call\n  Being quite perspicuous and extremely fair;\nThe truth is, I 've grown lately rather phthisical:\n  I don't know what the reason is—the air\nPerhaps; but as I suffer from the shocks\nOf illness, I grow much more orthodox.\n\nThe first attack at once proved the Divinity\n  (But that I never doubted, nor the Devil);\nThe next, the Virgin's mystical virginity;\n  The third, the usual Origin of Evil;\nThe fourth at once establish'd the whole Trinity\n  On so uncontrovertible a level,\nThat I devoutly wish'd the three were four,\nOn purpose to believe so much the more.\n\nTo our Theme.—The man who has stood on the Acropolis,\n  And look'd down over Attica; or he\nWho has sail'd where picturesque Constantinople is,\n  Or seen Timbuctoo, or hath taken tea\nIn small-eyed China's crockery-ware metropolis,\n  Or sat amidst the bricks of Nineveh,\nMay not think much of London's first appearance—\nBut ask him what he thinks of it a year hence?\n\nDon Juan had got out on Shooter's Hill;\n  Sunset the time, the place the same declivity\nWhich looks along that vale of good and ill\n  Where London streets ferment in full activity;\nWhile every thing around was calm and still,\n  Except the creak of wheels, which on their pivot he\nHeard,—and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum\nOf cities, that boil over with their scum:—\n\nI say, Don Juan, wrapt in contemplation,\n  Walk'd on behind his carriage, o'er the summit,\nAnd lost in wonder of so great a nation,\n  Gave way to 't, since he could not overcome it.\n'And here,' he cried, 'is Freedom's chosen station;\n  Here peals the people's voice, nor can entomb it\nRacks, prisons, inquisitions; resurrection\nAwaits it, each new meeting or election.\n\n'Here are chaste wives, pure lives; here people pay\n  But what they please; and if that things be dear,\n'T is only that they love to throw away\n  Their cash, to show how much they have a-year.\nHere laws are all inviolate; none lay\n  Traps for the traveller; every highway 's clear:\nHere-' he was interrupted by a knife,\nWith,—'Damn your eyes! your money or your life!'\n\nThese freeborn sounds proceeded from four pads\n  In ambush laid, who had perceived him loiter\nBehind his carriage; and, like handy lads,\n  Had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre,\nIn which the heedless gentleman who gads\n  Upon the road, unless he prove a fighter,\nMay find himself within that isle of riches\nExposed to lose his life as well as breeches.\n\nJuan, who did not understand a word\n  Of English, save their shibboleth, 'God damn!'\nAnd even that he had so rarely heard,\n  He sometimes thought 't was only their 'Salam,'\nOr 'God be with you!'—and 't is not absurd\n  To think so: for half English as I am\n(To my misfortune), never can I say\nI heard them wish 'God with you,' save that way;—\n\nJuan yet quickly understood their gesture,\n  And being somewhat choleric and sudden,\nDrew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture,\n  And fired it into one assailant's pudding—\nWho fell, as rolls an ox o'er in his pasture,\n  And roar'd out, as he writhed his native mud in,\nUnto his nearest follower or henchman,\n'Oh Jack! I 'm floor'd by that 'ere bloody Frenchman!'\n\nOn which Jack and his train set off at speed,\n  And Juan's suite, late scatter'd at a distance,\nCame up, all marvelling at such a deed,\n  And offering, as usual, late assistance.\nJuan, who saw the moon's late minion bleed\n  As if his veins would pour out his existence,\nStood calling out for bandages and lint,\nAnd wish'd he had been less hasty with his flint.\n\n'Perhaps,' thought he, 'it is the country's wont\n  To welcome foreigners in this way: now\nI recollect some innkeepers who don't\n  Differ, except in robbing with a bow,\nIn lieu of a bare blade and brazen front.\n  But what is to be done? I can't allow\nThe fellow to lie groaning on the road:\nSo take him up; I 'll help you with the load.'\n\nBut ere they could perform this pious duty,\n  The dying man cried, 'Hold! I 've got my gruel!\nO for a glass of max! We 've miss'd our booty;\n  Let me die where I am!' And as the fuel\nOf life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sooty\n  The drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew ill\nHis breath,—he from his swelling throat untied\nA kerchief, crying, 'Give Sal that!'—and died.\n\nThe cravat stain'd with bloody drops fell down\n  Before Don Juan's feet: he could not tell\nExactly why it was before him thrown,\n  Nor what the meaning of the man's farewell.\nPoor Tom was once a kiddy upon town,\n  A thorough varmint, and a real swell,\nFull flash, all fancy, until fairly diddled,\nHis pockets first and then his body riddled.\n\nDon Juan, having done the best he could\n  In all the circumstances of the case,\nAs soon as 'Crowner's quest' allow'd, pursued\n  His travels to the capital apace;—\nEsteeming it a little hard he should\n  In twelve hours' time, and very little space,\nHave been obliged to slay a freeborn native\nIn self-defence: this made him meditative.\n\nHe from the world had cut off a great man,\n  Who in his time had made heroic bustle.\nWho in a row like Tom could lead the van,\n  Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?\nWho queer a flat? Who (spite of Bow Street's ban)\n  On the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle?\nWho on a lark, with black-eyed Sal (his blowing),\nSo prime, so swell, so nutty, and so knowing?\n\nBut Tom's no more—and so no more of Tom.\n  Heroes must die; and by God's blessing 't is\nNot long before the most of them go home.\n  Hail! Thamis, Hail! Upon thy verge it is\nThat Juan's chariot, rolling like a drum\n  In thunder, holds the way it can't well miss,\nThrough Kennington and all the other 'tons,'\nWhich makes us wish ourselves in town at once;—\n\nThrough Groves, so call'd as being void of trees\n  (Like lucus from no light); through prospects named\nMount Pleasant, as containing nought to please,\n  Nor much to climb; through little boxes framed\nOf bricks, to let the dust in at your ease,\n  With 'To be let' upon their doors proclaim'd;\nThrough 'Rows' most modestly call'd 'Paradise,'\nWhich Eve might quit without much sacrifice;—\n\nThrough coaches, drays, choked turnpikes, and a whirl\n  Of wheels, and roar of voices, and confusion;\nHere taverns wooing to a pint of 'purl,'\n  There mails fast flying off like a delusion;\nThere barbers' blocks with periwigs in curl\n  In windows; here the lamplighter's infusion\nSlowly distill'd into the glimmering glass\n(For in those days we had not got to gas);—\n\nThrough this, and much, and more, is the approach\n  Of travellers to mighty Babylon:\nWhether they come by horse, or chaise, or coach,\n  With slight exceptions, all the ways seem one.\nI could say more, but do not choose to encroach\n  Upon the Guide-book's privilege. The sun\nHad set some time, and night was on the ridge\nOf twilight, as the party cross'd the bridge,—\n\nThat 's rather fine. The gentle sound of Thamis—\n  Who vindicates a moment, too, his stream,\nThough hardly heard through multifarious 'damme's'-\n  The lamps of Westminster's more regular gleam,\nThe breadth of pavement, and yon shrine where fame is\n  A spectral resident—whose pallid beam\nIn shape of moonshine hovers o'er the pile—\nMake this a sacred part of Albion's isle.\n\nThe Druids' groves are gone—so much the better:\n  Stone-Henge is not—but what the devil is it?-\nBut Bedlam still exists with its sage fetter,\n  That madmen may not bite you on a visit;\nThe Bench too seats or suits full many a debtor;\n  The Mansion House too (though some people quiz it)\nTo me appears a stiff yet grand erection;\nBut then the Abbey 's worth the whole collection.\n\nThe line of lights, too, up to Charing Cross,\n  Pall Mall, and so forth, have a coruscation\nLike gold as in comparison to dross,\n  Match'd with the Continent's illumination,\nWhose cities Night by no means deigns to gloss.\n  The French were not yet a lamp-lighting nation,\nAnd when they grew so—on their new-found lantern,\nInstead of wicks, they made a wicked man turn.\n\nA row of gentlemen along the streets\n  Suspended may illuminate mankind,\nAs also bonfires made of country seats;\n  But the old way is best for the purblind:\nThe other looks like phosphorus on sheets,\n  A sort of ignis fatuus to the mind,\nWhich, though 't is certain to perplex and frighten,\nMust burn more mildly ere it can enlighten.\n\nBut London 's so well lit, that if Diogenes\n  Could recommence to hunt his honest man,\nAnd found him not amidst the various progenies\n  Of this enormous city's spreading span,\n'T were not for want of lamps to aid his dodging his\n  Yet undiscover'd treasure. What I can,\nI 've done to find the same throughout life's journey,\nBut see the world is only one attorney.\n\nOver the stones still rattling up Pall Mall,\n  Through crowds and carriages, but waxing thinner\nAs thunder'd knockers broke the long seal'd spell\n  Of doors 'gainst duns, and to an early dinner\nAdmitted a small party as night fell,—\n  Don Juan, our young diplomatic sinner,\nPursued his path, and drove past some hotels,\nSt. James's Palace and St. James's 'Hells.'\n\nThey reach'd the hotel: forth stream'd from the front door\n  A tide of well-clad waiters, and around\nThe mob stood, and as usual several score\n  Of those pedestrian Paphians who abound\nIn decent London when the daylight 's o'er;\n  Commodious but immoral, they are found\nUseful, like Malthus, in promoting marriage.-\nBut Juan now is stepping from his carriage\n\nInto one of the sweetest of hotels,\n  Especially for foreigners—and mostly\nFor those whom favour or whom fortune swells,\n  And cannot find a bill's small items costly.\nThere many an envoy either dwelt or dwells\n  (The den of many a diplomatic lost lie),\nUntil to some conspicuous square they pass,\nAnd blazon o'er the door their names in brass.\n\nJuan, whose was a delicate commission,\n  Private, though publicly important, bore\nNo title to point out with due precision\n  The exact affair on which he was sent o'er.\n'T was merely known, that on a secret mission\n  A foreigner of rank had graced our shore,\nYoung, handsome, and accomplish'd, who was said\n(In whispers) to have turn'd his sovereign's head.\n\nSome rumour also of some strange adventures\n  Had gone before him, and his wars and loves;\nAnd as romantic heads are pretty painters,\n  And, above all, an Englishwoman's roves\nInto the excursive, breaking the indentures\n  Of sober reason wheresoe'er it moves,\nHe found himself extremely in the fashion,\nWhich serves our thinking people for a passion.\n\nI don't mean that they are passionless, but quite\n  The contrary; but then 't is in the head;\nYet as the consequences are as bright\n  As if they acted with the heart instead,\nWhat after all can signify the site\n  Of ladies' lucubrations? So they lead\nIn safety to the place for which you start,\nWhat matters if the road be head or heart?\n\nJuan presented in the proper place,\n  To proper placemen, every Russ credential;\nAnd was received with all the due grimace\n  By those who govern in the mood potential,\nWho, seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face,\n  Thought (what in state affairs is most essential)\nThat they as easily might do the youngster,\nAs hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster.\n\nThey err'd, as aged men will do; but by\n  And by we 'll talk of that; and if we don't,\n'T will be because our notion is not high\n  Of politicians and their double front,\nWho live by lies, yet dare not boldly lie:—\n  Now what I love in women is, they won't\nOr can't do otherwise than lie, but do it\nSo well, the very truth seems falsehood to it.\n\nAnd, after all, what is a lie? 'T is but\n  The truth in masquerade; and I defy\nHistorians, heroes, lawyers, priests, to put\n  A fact without some leaven of a lie.\nThe very shadow of true Truth would shut\n  Up annals, revelations, poesy,\nAnd prophecy—except it should be dated\nSome years before the incidents related.\n\nPraised be all liars and all lies! Who now\n  Can tax my mild Muse with misanthropy?\nShe rings the world's 'Te Deum,' and her brow\n  Blushes for those who will not:—but to sigh\nIs idle; let us like most others bow,\n  Kiss hands, feet, any part of majesty,\nAfter the good example of 'Green Erin,'\nWhose shamrock now seems rather worse for wearing.\n\nDon Juan was presented, and his dress\n  And mien excited general admiration—\nI don't know which was more admired or less:\n  One monstrous diamond drew much observation,\nWhich Catherine in a moment of 'ivresse'\n  (In love or brandy's fervent fermentation)\nBestow'd upon him, as the public learn'd;\nAnd, to say truth, it had been fairly earn'd.\n\nBesides the ministers and underlings,\n  Who must be courteous to the accredited\nDiplomatists of rather wavering kings,\n  Until their royal riddle 's fully read,\nThe very clerks,—those somewhat dirty springs\n  Of office, or the house of office, fed\nBy foul corruption into streams,—even they\nWere hardly rude enough to earn their pay:\n\nAnd insolence no doubt is what they are\n  Employ'd for, since it is their daily labour,\nIn the dear offices of peace or war;\n  And should you doubt, pray ask of your next neighbour,\nWhen for a passport, or some other bar\n  To freedom, he applied (a grief and a bore),\nIf he found not his spawn of taxborn riches,\n\nBut Juan was received with much 'empressement:'-\n  These phrases of refinement I must borrow\nFrom our next neighbours' land, where, like a chessman,\n  There is a move set down for joy or sorrow\nNot only in mere talking, but the press. Man\n  In islands is, it seems, downright and thorough,\nMore than on continents—as if the sea\n(See Billingsgate) made even the tongue more free.\n\nAnd yet the British 'Damme' 's rather Attic:\n  Your continental oaths are but incontinent,\nAnd turn on things which no aristocratic\n  Spirit would name, and therefore even I won't anent\nThis subject quote; as it would be schismatic\n  In politesse, and have a sound affronting in 't:—\nBut 'Damme' 's quite ethereal, though too daring—\nPlatonic blasphemy, the soul of swearing.\n\nFor downright rudeness, ye may stay at home;\n  For true or false politeness (and scarce that\nNow) you may cross the blue deep and white foam—\n  The first the emblem (rarely though) of what\nYou leave behind, the next of much you come\n  To meet. However, 't is no time to chat\nOn general topics: poems must confine\nThemselves to unity, like this of mine.\n\nIn the great world,—which, being interpreted,\n  Meaneth the west or worst end of a city,\nAnd about twice two thousand people bred\n  By no means to be very wise or witty,\nBut to sit up while others lie in bed,\n  And look down on the universe with pity,—\nJuan, as an inveterate patrician,\nWas well received by persons of condition.\n\nHe was a bachelor, which is a matter\n  Of import both to virgin and to bride,\nThe former's hymeneal hopes to flatter;\n  And (should she not hold fast by love or pride)\n'T is also of some moment to the latter:\n  A rib 's a thorn in a wed gallant's side,\nRequires decorum, and is apt to double\nThe horrid sin—and what 's still worse, the trouble.\n\nBut Juan was a bachelor—of arts,\n  And parts, and hearts: he danced and sung, and had\nAn air as sentimental as Mozart's\n  Softest of melodies; and could be sad\nOr cheerful, without any 'flaws or starts,'\n  Just at the proper time; and though a lad,\nHad seen the world—which is a curious sight,\nAnd very much unlike what people write.\n\nFair virgins blush'd upon him; wedded dames\n  Bloom'd also in less transitory hues;\nFor both commodities dwell by the Thames,\n  The painting and the painted; youth, ceruse,\nAgainst his heart preferr'd their usual claims,\n  Such as no gentleman can quite refuse:\nDaughters admired his dress, and pious mothers\nInquired his income, and if he had brothers.\n\nThe milliners who furnish 'drapery Misses'\n  Throughout the season, upon speculation\nOf payment ere the honey-moon's last kisses\n  Have waned into a crescent's coruscation,\nThought such an opportunity as this is,\n  Of a rich foreigner's initiation,\nNot to be overlook'd—and gave such credit,\nThat future bridegrooms swore, and sigh'd, and paid it.\n\nThe Blues, that tender tribe who sigh o'er sonnets,\n  And with the pages of the last Review\nLine the interior of their heads or bonnets,\n  Advanced in all their azure's highest hue:\nThey talk'd bad French or Spanish, and upon its\n  Late authors ask'd him for a hint or two;\nAnd which was softest, Russian or Castilian?\nAnd whether in his travels he saw Ilion?\n\nJuan, who was a little superficial,\n  And not in literature a great Drawcansir,\nExamined by this learned and especial\n  Jury of matrons, scarce knew what to answer:\nHis duties warlike, loving or official,\n  His steady application as a dancer,\nHad kept him from the brink of Hippocrene,\nWhich now he found was blue instead of green.\n\nHowever, he replied at hazard, with\n  A modest confidence and calm assurance,\nWhich lent his learned lucubrations pith,\n  And pass'd for arguments of good endurance.\nThat prodigy, Miss Araminta Smith\n  (Who at sixteen translated 'Hercules Furens'\nInto as furious English), with her best look,\nSet down his sayings in her common-place book.\n\nJuan knew several languages—as well\n  He might—and brought them up with skill, in time\nTo save his fame with each accomplish'd belle,\n  Who still regretted that he did not rhyme.\nThere wanted but this requisite to swell\n  His qualities (with them) into sublime:\nLady Fitz-Frisky, and Miss Maevia Mannish,\nBoth long'd extremely to be sung in Spanish.\n\nHowever, he did pretty well, and was\n  Admitted as an aspirant to all\nThe coteries, and, as in Banquo's glass,\n  At great assemblies or in parties small,\nHe saw ten thousand living authors pass,\n  That being about their average numeral;\nAlso the eighty 'greatest living poets,'\nAs every paltry magazine can show its.\n\nIn twice five years the 'greatest living poet,'\n  Like to the champion in the fisty ring,\nIs call'd on to support his claim, or show it,\n  Although 't is an imaginary thing.\nEven I—albeit I 'm sure I did not know it,\n  Nor sought of foolscap subjects to be king—\nWas reckon'd a considerable time,\nThe grand Napoleon of the realms of rhyme.\n\nBut Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero\n  My Leipsic, and my Mount Saint Jean seems Cain:\n'La Belle Alliance' of dunces down at zero,\n  Now that the Lion 's fall'n, may rise again:\nBut I will fall at least as fell my hero;\n  Nor reign at all, or as a monarch reign;\nOr to some lonely isle of gaolers go,\nWith turncoat Southey for my turnkey Lowe.\n\nSir Walter reign'd before me; Moore and Campbell\n  Before and after; but now grown more holy,\nThe Muses upon Sion's hill must ramble\n  With poets almost clergymen, or wholly;\nAnd Pegasus hath a psalmodic amble\n  Beneath the very Reverend Rowley Powley,\nWho shoes the glorious animal with stilts,\nA modern Ancient Pistol—by the hilts?\n\nThen there 's my gentle Euphues, who, they say,\n  Sets up for being a sort of moral me;\nHe 'll find it rather difficult some day\n  To turn out both, or either, it may be.\nSome persons think that Coleridge hath the sway;\n  And Wordsworth has supporters, two or three;\nAnd that deep-mouth'd Boeotian 'Savage Landor'\nHas taken for a swan rogue Southey's gander.\n\nJohn Keats, who was kill'd off by one critique,\n  Just as he really promised something great,\nIf not intelligible, without Greek\n  Contrived to talk about the gods of late,\nMuch as they might have been supposed to speak.\n  Poor fellow! His was an untoward fate;\n'T is strange the mind, that very fiery particle,\nShould let itself be snuff'd out by an article.\n\nThe list grows long of live and dead pretenders\n  To that which none will gain—or none will know\nThe conqueror at least; who, ere Time renders\n  His last award, will have the long grass grow\nAbove his burnt-out brain, and sapless cinders.\n  If I might augur, I should rate but low\nTheir chances; they 're too numerous, like the thirty\nMock tyrants, when Rome's annals wax'd but dirty.\n\nThis is the literary lower empire,\n  Where the praetorian bands take up the matter;—\nA 'dreadful trade,' like his who 'gathers samphire,'\n  The insolent soldiery to soothe and flatter,\nWith the same feelings as you 'd coax a vampire.\n  Now, were I once at home, and in good satire,\nI 'd try conclusions with those Janizaries,\nAnd show them what an intellectual war is.\n\nI think I know a trick or two, would turn\n  Their flanks;—but it is hardly worth my while\nWith such small gear to give myself concern:\n  Indeed I 've not the necessary bile;\nMy natural temper 's really aught but stern,\n  And even my Muse's worst reproof 's a smile;\nAnd then she drops a brief and modern curtsy,\nAnd glides away, assured she never hurts ye.\n\nMy Juan, whom I left in deadly peril\n  Amongst live poets and blue ladies, past\nWith some small profit through that field so sterile,\n  Being tired in time, and, neither least nor last,\nLeft it before he had been treated very ill;\n  And henceforth found himself more gaily class'd\nAmongst the higher spirits of the day,\nThe sun's true son, no vapour, but a ray.\n\nHis morns he pass'd in business—which, dissected,\n  Was like all business a laborious nothing\nThat leads to lassitude, the most infected\n  And Centaur Nessus garb of mortal clothing,\nAnd on our sofas makes us lie dejected,\n  And talk in tender horrors of our loathing\nAll kinds of toil, save for our country's good—\nWhich grows no better, though 't is time it should.\n\nHis afternoons he pass'd in visits, luncheons,\n  Lounging and boxing; and the twilight hour\nIn riding round those vegetable puncheons\n  Call'd 'Parks,' where there is neither fruit nor flower\nEnough to gratify a bee's slight munchings;\n  But after all it is the only 'bower'\n(In Moore's phrase), where the fashionable fair\nCan form a slight acquaintance with fresh air.\n\nThen dress, then dinner, then awakes the world!\n  Then glare the lamps, then whirl the wheels, then roar\nThrough street and square fast flashing chariots hurl'd\n  Like harness'd meteors; then along the floor\nChalk mimics painting; then festoons are twirl'd;\n  Then roll the brazen thunders of the door,\nWhich opens to the thousand happy few\nAn earthly paradise of 'Or Molu.'\n\nThere stands the noble hostess, nor shall sink\n  With the three-thousandth curtsy; there the waltz,\nThe only dance which teaches girls to think,\n  Makes one in love even with its very faults.\nSaloon, room, hall, o'erflow beyond their brink,\n  And long the latest of arrivals halts,\n'Midst royal dukes and dames condemn'd to climb,\nAnd gain an inch of staircase at a time.\n\nThrice happy he who, after a survey\n  Of the good company, can win a corner,\nA door that's in or boudoir out of the way,\n  Where he may fix himself like small 'Jack Horner,'\nAnd let the Babel round run as it may,\n  And look on as a mourner, or a scorner,\nOr an approver, or a mere spectator,\nYawning a little as the night grows later.\n\nBut this won't do, save by and by; and he\n  Who, like Don Juan, takes an active share,\nMust steer with care through all that glittering sea\n  Of gems and plumes and pearls and silks, to where\nHe deems it is his proper place to be;\n  Dissolving in the waltz to some soft air,\nOr proudlier prancing with mercurial skill\nWhere Science marshals forth her own quadrille.\n\nOr, if he dance not, but hath higher views\n  Upon an heiress or his neighbour's bride,\nLet him take care that that which he pursues\n  Is not at once too palpably descried.\nFull many an eager gentleman oft rues\n  His haste: impatience is a blundering guide,\nAmongst a people famous for reflection,\nWho like to play the fool with circumspection.\n\nBut, if you can contrive, get next at supper;\n  Or, if forestalled, get opposite and ogle:—\nO, ye ambrosial moments! always upper\n  In mind, a sort of sentimental bogle,\nWhich sits for ever upon memory's crupper,\n  The ghost of vanish'd pleasures once in vogue! Ill\nCan tender souls relate the rise and fall\nOf hopes and fears which shake a single ball.\n\nBut these precautionary hints can touch\n  Only the common run, who must pursue,\nAnd watch, and ward; whose plans a word too much\n  Or little overturns; and not the few\nOr many (for the number's sometimes such)\n  Whom a good mien, especially if new,\nOr fame, or name, for wit, war, sense, or nonsense,\nPermits whate'er they please, or did not long since.\n\nOur hero, as a hero, young and handsome,\n  Noble, rich, celebrated, and a stranger,\nLike other slaves of course must pay his ransom,\n  Before he can escape from so much danger\nAs will environ a conspicuous man. Some\n  Talk about poetry, and 'rack and manger,'\nAnd ugliness, disease, as toil and trouble;—\nI wish they knew the life of a young noble.\n\nThey are young, but know not youth—it is anticipated;\n  Handsome but wasted, rich without a sou;\nTheir vigour in a thousand arms is dissipated;\n  Their cash comes from, their wealth goes to a Jew;\nBoth senates see their nightly votes participated\n  Between the tyrant's and the tribunes' crew;\nAnd having voted, dined, drunk, gamed, and whored,\nThe family vault receives another lord.\n\n'Where is the world?' cries Young, at eighty—'Where\n  The world in which a man was born? 'Alas!\nWhere is the world of eight years past? 'T was there—\n  I look for it—'t is gone, a globe of glass!\nCrack'd, shiver'd, vanish'd, scarcely gazed on, ere\n  A silent change dissolves the glittering mass.\nStatesmen, chiefs, orators, queens, patriots, kings,\nAnd dandies, all are gone on the wind's wings.\n\nWhere is Napoleon the Grand? God knows.\n  Where little Castlereagh? The devil can tell:\nWhere Grattan, Curran, Sheridan, all those\n  Who bound the bar or senate in their spell?\nWhere is the unhappy Queen, with all her woes?\n  And where the Daughter, whom the Isles loved well?\nWhere are those martyr'd saints the Five per Cents?\nAnd where—oh, where the devil are the rents?\n\nWhere 's Brummel? Dish'd. Where 's Long Pole Wellesley? Diddled.\n  Where 's Whitbread? Romilly? Where 's George the Third?\nWhere is his will? (That 's not so soon unriddled.)\n  And where is 'Fum' the Fourth, our 'royal bird?'\nGone down, it seems, to Scotland to be fiddled\n  Unto by Sawney's violin, we have heard:\n'Caw me, caw thee'—for six months hath been hatching\nThis scene of royal itch and loyal scratching.\n\nWhere is Lord This? And where my Lady That?\n  The Honourable Mistresses and Misses?\nSome laid aside like an old Opera hat,\n  Married, unmarried, and remarried (this is\nAn evolution oft performed of late).\n  Where are the Dublin shouts—and London hisses?\nWhere are the Grenvilles? Turn'd as usual. Where\nMy friends the Whigs? Exactly where they were.\n\nWhere are the Lady Carolines and Franceses?\n  Divorced or doing thereanent. Ye annals\nSo brilliant, where the list of routs and dances is,—\n  Thou Morning Post, sole record of the panels\nBroken in carriages, and all the phantasies\n  Of fashion,—say what streams now fill those channels?\nSome die, some fly, some languish on the Continent,\nBecause the times have hardly left them one tenant.\n\nSome who once set their caps at cautious dukes,\n  Have taken up at length with younger brothers:\nSome heiresses have bit at sharpers' hooks:\n  Some maids have been made wives, some merely mothers;\nOthers have lost their fresh and fairy looks:\n  In short, the list of alterations bothers.\nThere 's little strange in this, but something strange is\nThe unusual quickness of these common changes.\n\nTalk not of seventy years as age; in seven\n  I have seen more changes, down from monarchs to\nThe humblest individual under heaven,\n  Than might suffice a moderate century through.\nI knew that nought was lasting, but now even\n  Change grows too changeable, without being new:\nNought 's permanent among the human race,\nExcept the Whigs not getting into place.\n\nI have seen Napoleon, who seem'd quite a Jupiter,\n  Shrink to a Saturn. I have seen a Duke\n(No matter which) turn politician stupider,\n  If that can well be, than his wooden look.\nBut it is time that I should hoist my 'blue Peter,'\n  And sail for a new theme:—I have seen—and shook\nTo see it—the king hiss'd, and then caress'd;\nBut don't pretend to settle which was best.\n\nI have seen the Landholders without a rap—\n  I have seen Joanna Southcote—I have seen—\nThe House of Commons turn'd to a tax-trap—\n  I have seen that sad affair of the late Queen—\nI have seen crowns worn instead of a fool's cap—\n  I have seen a Congress doing all that 's mean—\nI have seen some nations like o'erloaded asses\nKick off their burthens, meaning the high classes.\n\nI have seen small poets, and great prosers, and\n  Interminable—not eternal—speakers—\nI have seen the funds at war with house and land—\n  I have seen the country gentlemen turn squeakers—\nI have seen the people ridden o'er like sand\n  By slaves on horseback—I have seen malt liquors\nExchanged for 'thin potations' by John Bull—\nI have seen john half detect himself a fool.-\n\nBut 'carpe diem,' Juan, 'carpe, carpe!'\n  To-morrow sees another race as gay\nAnd transient, and devour'd by the same harpy.\n  'Life 's a poor player,'—then 'play out the play,\nYe villains!' above all keep a sharp eye\n  Much less on what you do than what you say:\nBe hypocritical, be cautious, be\nNot what you seem, but always what you see.\n\nBut how shall I relate in other cantos\n  Of what befell our hero in the land,\nWhich 't is the common cry and lie to vaunt as\n  A moral country? But I hold my hand—\nFor I disdain to write an Atalantis;\n  But 't is as well at once to understand,\nYou are not a moral people, and you know it\nWithout the aid of too sincere a poet.\n\nWhat Juan saw and underwent shall be\n  My topic, with of course the due restriction\nWhich is required by proper courtesy;\n  And recollect the work is only fiction,\nAnd that I sing of neither mine nor me,\n  Though every scribe, in some slight turn of diction,\nWill hint allusions never meant. Ne'er doubt\nThis—when I speak, I don't hint, but speak out.\n\nWhether he married with the third or fourth\n  Offspring of some sage husband-hunting countess,\nOr whether with some virgin of more worth\n  (I mean in Fortune's matrimonial bounties)\nHe took to regularly peopling Earth,\n  Of which your lawful awful wedlock fount is,—\nOr whether he was taken in for damages,\nFor being too excursive in his homages,—\n\nIs yet within the unread events of time.\n  Thus far, go forth, thou lay, which I will back\nAgainst the same given quantity of rhyme,\n  For being as much the subject of attack\nAs ever yet was any work sublime,\n  By those who love to say that white is black.\nSo much the better!—I may stand alone,\nBut would not change my free thoughts for a throne.</code>"

Why call we misers miserable?\n  Theirs is the pleasure that can never pall;\nTheirs is the best bower anchor, the chain cable\n  Which holds fast other pleasures great and small.\nYe who but see the saving man at table,\n  And scorn his temperate board, as none at all,\nAnd wonder how the wealthy can be sparing,\nKnow not what visions spring from each cheese-paring.\n\nLove or lust makes man sick, and wine much sicker;\n  Ambition rends, and gaming gains a loss;\nBut making money, slowly first, then quicker,\n  And adding still a little through each cross\n(Which will come over things), beats love or liquor,\n  The gamester's counter, or the statesman's dross.\nO Gold! I still prefer thee unto paper,\nWhich makes bank credit like a bank of vapour.\n\nWho hold the balance of the world? Who reign\n  O'er congress, whether royalist or liberal?\nWho rouse the shirtless patriots of Spain?\n  (That make old Europe's journals squeak and gibber all.)\nWho keep the world, both old and new, in pain\n  Or pleasure? Who make politics run glibber all?\nThe shade of Buonaparte's noble daring?-\nJew Rothschild, and his fellow-Christian, Baring.\n\nThose, and the truly liberal Lafitte,\n  Are the true lords of Europe. Every loan\nIs not a merely speculative hit,\n  But seats a nation or upsets a throne.\nRepublics also get involved a bit;\n  Columbia's stock hath holders not unknown\nOn 'Change; and even thy silver soil, Peru,\nMust get itself discounted by a Jew.\n\nWhy call the miser miserable? as\n  I said before: the frugal life is his,\nWhich in a saint or cynic ever was\n  The theme of praise: a hermit would not miss\nCanonization for the self-same cause,\n  And wherefore blame gaunt wealth's austerities?\nBecause, you 'll say, nought calls for such a trial;—\nThen there 's more merit in his self-denial.\n\nHe is your only poet;—passion, pure\n  And sparkling on from heap to heap, displays,\nPossess'd, the ore, of which mere hopes allure\n  Nations athwart the deep: the golden rays\nFlash up in ingots from the mine obscure;\n  On him the diamond pours its brilliant blaze,\nWhile the mild emerald's beam shades down the dies\nOf other stones, to soothe the miser's eyes.\n\nThe lands on either side are his; the ship\n  From Ceylon, Inde, or far Cathay, unloads\nFor him the fragrant produce of each trip;\n  Beneath his cars of Ceres groan the roads,\nAnd the vine blushes like Aurora's lip;\n  His very cellars might be kings' abodes;\nWhile he, despising every sensual call,\nCommands—the intellectual lord of all.\n\nPerhaps he hath great projects in his mind,\n  To build a college, or to found a race,\nA hospital, a church,—and leave behind\n  Some dome surmounted by his meagre face:\nPerhaps he fain would liberate mankind\n  Even with the very ore which makes them base;\nPerhaps he would be wealthiest of his nation,\nOr revel in the joys of calculation.\n\nBut whether all, or each, or none of these\n  May be the hoarder's principle of action,\nThe fool will call such mania a disease:—\n  What is his own? Go—look at each transaction,\nWars, revels, loves—do these bring men more ease\n  Than the mere plodding through each 'vulgar fraction'?\nOr do they benefit mankind? Lean miser!\nLet spendthrifts' heirs enquire of yours—who 's wiser?\n\nHow beauteous are rouleaus! how charming chests\n  Containing ingots, bags of dollars, coins\n(Not of old victors, all whose heads and crests\n  Weigh not the thin ore where their visage shines,\nBut) of fine unclipt gold, where dully rests\n  Some likeness, which the glittering cirque confines,\nOf modern, reigning, sterling, stupid stamp:—\nYes! ready money is Aladdin's lamp.\n\n'Love rules the camp, the court, the grove,'—'for love\n  Is heaven, and heaven is love:'—so sings the bard;\nWhich it were rather difficult to prove\n  (A thing with poetry in general hard).\nPerhaps there may be something in 'the grove,'\n  At least it rhymes to 'love;' but I 'm prepared\nTo doubt (no less than landlords of their rental)\nIf 'courts' and 'camps' be quite so sentimental.\n\nBut if Love don't, Cash does, and Cash alone:\n  Cash rules the grove, and fells it too besides;\nWithout cash, camps were thin, and courts were none;\n  Without cash, Malthus tells you—'take no brides.'\nSo Cash rules Love the ruler, on his own\n  High ground, as virgin Cynthia sways the tides:\nAnd as for Heaven 'Heaven being Love,' why not say honey\nIs wax? Heaven is not Love, 't is Matrimony.\n\nIs not all love prohibited whatever,\n  Excepting marriage? which is love, no doubt,\nAfter a sort; but somehow people never\n  With the same thought the two words have help'd out:\nLove may exist with marriage, and should ever,\n  And marriage also may exist without;\nBut love sans bans is both a sin and shame,\nAnd ought to go by quite another name.\n\nNow if the 'court,' and 'camp,' and 'grove,' be not\n  Recruited all with constant married men,\nWho never coveted their neighbour's lot,\n  I say that line 's a lapsus of the pen;—\nStrange too in my 'buon camerado' Scott,\n  So celebrated for his morals, when\nMy Jeffrey held him up as an example\nTo me;—of whom these morals are a sample.\n\nWell, if I don't succeed, I have succeeded,\n  And that 's enough; succeeded in my youth,\nThe only time when much success is needed:\n  And my success produced what I, in sooth,\nCared most about; it need not now be pleaded—\n  Whate'er it was, 't was mine; I 've paid, in truth,\nOf late the penalty of such success,\nBut have not learn'd to wish it any less.\n\nThat suit in Chancery,—which some persons plead\n  In an appeal to the unborn, whom they,\nIn the faith of their procreative creed,\n  Baptize posterity, or future clay,—\nTo me seems but a dubious kind of reed\n  To lean on for support in any way;\nSince odds are that posterity will know\nNo more of them, than they of her, I trow.\n\nWhy, I 'm posterity—and so are you;\n  And whom do we remember? Not a hundred.\nWere every memory written down all true,\n  The tenth or twentieth name would be but blunder'd;\nEven Plutarch's Lives have but pick'd out a few,\n  And 'gainst those few your annalists have thunder'd;\nAnd Mitford in the nineteenth century\nGives, with Greek truth, the good old Greek the lie.\n\nGood people all, of every degree,\n  Ye gentle readers and ungentle writers,\nIn this twelfth Canto 't is my wish to be\n  As serious as if I had for inditers\nMalthus and Wilberforce:—the last set free\n  The Negroes and is worth a million fighters;\nWhile Wellington has but enslaved the Whites,\nAnd Malthus does the thing 'gainst which he writes.\n\nI 'm serious—so are all men upon paper;\n  And why should I not form my speculation,\nAnd hold up to the sun my little taper?\n  Mankind just now seem wrapt in mediation\nOn constitutions and steam-boats of vapour;\n  While sages write against all procreation,\nUnless a man can calculate his means\nOf feeding brats the moment his wife weans.\n\nThat 's noble! That 's romantic! For my part,\n  I think that 'Philo-genitiveness' is\n(Now here 's a word quite after my own heart,\n  Though there 's a shorter a good deal than this,\nIf that politeness set it not apart;\n  But I 'm resolved to say nought that 's amiss)—\nI say, methinks that 'Philo-genitiveness'\nMight meet from men a little more forgiveness.\n\nAnd now to business.—O my gentle Juan,\n  Thou art in London—in that pleasant place,\nWhere every kind of mischief 's daily brewing,\n  Which can await warm youth in its wild race.\n'T is true, that thy career is not a new one;\n  Thou art no novice in the headlong chase\nOf early life; but this is a new land,\nWhich foreigners can never understand.\n\nWhat with a small diversity of climate,\n  Of hot or cold, mercurial or sedate,\nI could send forth my mandate like a primate\n  Upon the rest of Europe's social state;\nBut thou art the most difficult to rhyme at,\n  Great Britain, which the Muse may penetrate.\nAll countries have their 'Lions,' but in the\nThere is but one superb menagerie.\n\nBut I am sick of politics. Begin,\n  'Paulo Majora.' Juan, undecided\nAmongst the paths of being 'taken in,'\n  Above the ice had like a skater glided:\nWhen tired of play, he flirted without sin\n  With some of those fair creatures who have prided\nThemselves on innocent tantalisation,\nAnd hate all vice except its reputation.\n\nBut these are few, and in the end they make\n  Some devilish escapade or stir, which shows\nThat even the purest people may mistake\n  Their way through virtue's primrose paths of snows;\nAnd then men stare, as if a new ass spake\n  To Balaam, and from tongue to ear o'erflows\nQuicksilver small talk, ending (if you note it)\nWith the kind world's amen—'Who would have thought it?'\n\nThe little Leila, with her orient eyes,\n  And taciturn Asiatic disposition\n(Which saw all western things with small surprise,\n  To the surprise of people of condition,\nWho think that novelties are butterflies\n  To be pursued as food for inanition),\nHer charming figure and romantic history\nBecame a kind of fashionable mystery.\n\nThe women much divided—as is usual\n  Amongst the sex in little things or great.\nThink not, fair creatures, that I mean to abuse you all—\n  I have always liked you better than I state:\nSince I 've grown moral, still I must accuse you all\n  Of being apt to talk at a great rate;\nAnd now there was a general sensation\nAmongst you, about Leila's education.\n\nIn one point only were you settled—and\n  You had reason; 't was that a young child of grace,\nAs beautiful as her own native land,\n  And far away, the last bud of her race,\nHowe'er our friend Don Juan might command\n  Himself for five, four, three, or two years' space,\nWould be much better taught beneath the eye\nOf peeresses whose follies had run dry.\n\nSo first there was a generous emulation,\n  And then there was a general competition,\nTo undertake the orphan's education.\n  As Juan was a person of condition,\nIt had been an affront on this occasion\n  To talk of a subscription or petition;\nBut sixteen dowagers, ten unwed she sages,\nWhose tale belongs to 'Hallam's Middle Ages,'\n\nAnd one or two sad, separate wives, without\n  A fruit to bloom upon their withering bough—\nBegg'd to bring up the little girl and 'out,'-\n  For that 's the phrase that settles all things now,\nMeaning a virgin's first blush at a rout,\n  And all her points as thorough-bred to show:\nAnd I assure you, that like virgin honey\nTastes their first season (mostly if they have money).\n\nHow all the needy honourable misters,\n  Each out-at-elbow peer, or desperate dandy,\nThe watchful mothers, and the careful sisters\n  (Who, by the by, when clever, are more handy\nAt making matches, where ''t is gold that glisters,'\n  Than their he relatives), like flies o'er candy\nBuzz round 'the Fortune' with their busy battery,\nTo turn her head with waltzing and with flattery!\n\nEach aunt, each cousin, hath her speculation;\n  Nay, married dames will now and then discover\nSuch pure disinterestedness of passion,\n  I 've known them court an heiress for their lover.\n'Tantaene!' Such the virtues of high station,\n  Even in the hopeful Isle, whose outlet 's 'Dover!'\nWhile the poor rich wretch, object of these cares,\nHas cause to wish her sire had had male heirs.\n\nSome are soon bagg'd, and some reject three dozen.\n  'T is fine to see them scattering refusals\nAnd wild dismay o'er every angry cousin\n  (Friends of the party), who begin accusals,\nSuch as—'Unless Miss (Blank) meant to have chosen\n  Poor Frederick, why did she accord perusals\nTo his billets? Why waltz with him? Why, I pray,\nLook yes last night, and yet say no to-day?\n\n'Why?—Why?—Besides, Fred really was attach'd;\n  'T was not her fortune—he has enough without:\nThe time will come she 'll wish that she had snatch'd\n  So good an opportunity, no doubt:—\nBut the old marchioness some plan had hatch'd,\n  As I 'll tell Aurea at to-morrow's rout:\nAnd after all poor Frederick may do better—\nPray did you see her answer to his letter?'\n\nSmart uniforms and sparkling coronets\n  Are spurn'd in turn, until her turn arrives,\nAfter male loss of time, and hearts, and bets\n  Upon the sweepstakes for substantial wives;\nAnd when at last the pretty creature gets\n  Some gentleman, who fights, or writes, or drives,\nIt soothes the awkward squad of the rejected\nTo find how very badly she selected.\n\nFor sometimes they accept some long pursuer,\n  Worn out with importunity; or fall\n(But here perhaps the instances are fewer)\n  To the lot of him who scarce pursued at all.\nA hazy widower turn'd of forty 's sure\n  (If 't is not vain examples to recall)\nTo draw a high prize: now, howe'er he got her, I\nSee nought more strange in this than t' other lottery.\n\nI, for my part (one 'modern instance' more,\n  'True, 't is a pity—pity 't is, 't is true'),\nWas chosen from out an amatory score,\n  Albeit my years were less discreet than few;\nBut though I also had reform'd before\n  Those became one who soon were to be two,\nI 'll not gainsay the generous public's voice,\nThat the young lady made a monstrous choice.\n\nO, pardon my digression—or at least\n  Peruse! 'T is always with a moral end\nThat I dissert, like grace before a feast:\n  For like an aged aunt, or tiresome friend,\nA rigid guardian, or a zealous priest,\n  My Muse by exhortation means to mend\nAll people, at all times, and in most places,\nWhich puts my Pegasus to these grave paces.\n\nBut now I 'm going to be immoral; now\n  I mean to show things really as they are,\nNot as they ought to be: for I avow,\n  That till we see what 's what in fact, we 're far\nFrom much improvement with that virtuous plough\n  Which skims the surface, leaving scarce a scar\nUpon the black loam long manured by Vice,\nOnly to keep its corn at the old price.\n\nBut first of little Leila we 'll dispose;\n  For like a day-dawn she was young and pure,\nOr like the old comparison of snows,\n  Which are more pure than pleasant to be sure.\nLike many people everybody knows,\n  Don Juan was delighted to secure\nA goodly guardian for his infant charge,\nWho might not profit much by being at large.\n\nBesides, he had found out he was no tutor\n  (I wish that others would find out the same);\nAnd rather wish'd in such things to stand neuter,\n  For silly wards will bring their guardians blame:\nSo when he saw each ancient dame a suitor\n  To make his little wild Asiatic tame,\nConsulting 'the Society for Vice\nSuppression,' Lady Pinchbeck was his choice.\n\nOlden she was—but had been very young;\n  Virtuous she was—and had been, I believe;\nAlthough the world has such an evil tongue\n  That—but my chaster ear will not receive\nAn echo of a syllable that 's wrong:\n  In fact, there 's nothing makes me so much grieve,\nAs that abominable tittle-tattle,\nWhich is the cud eschew'd by human cattle.\n\nMoreover I 've remark'd (and I was once\n  A slight observer in a modest way),\nAnd so may every one except a dunce,\n  That ladies in their youth a little gay,\nBesides their knowledge of the world, and sense\n  Of the sad consequence of going astray,\nAre wiser in their warnings 'gainst the woe\nWhich the mere passionless can never know.\n\nWhile the harsh prude indemnifies her virtue\n  By railing at the unknown and envied passion,\nSeeking far less to save you than to hurt you,\n  Or, what 's still worse, to put you out of fashion,—\nThe kinder veteran with calm words will court you,\n  Entreating you to pause before you dash on;\nExpounding and illustrating the riddle\nOf epic Love's beginning, end, and middle.\n\nNow whether it be thus, or that they are stricter,\n  As better knowing why they should be so,\nI think you 'll find from many a family picture,\n  That daughters of such mothers as may know\nThe world by experience rather than by lecture,\n  Turn out much better for the Smithfield Show\nOf vestals brought into the marriage mart,\nThan those bred up by prudes without a heart.\n\nI said that Lady Pinchbeck had been talk'd about—\n  As who has not, if female, young, and pretty?\nBut now no more the ghost of Scandal stalk'd about;\n  She merely was deem'd amiable and witty,\nAnd several of her best bon-mots were hawk'd about:\n  Then she was given to charity and pity,\nAnd pass'd (at least the latter years of life)\nFor being a most exemplary wife.\n\nHigh in high circles, gentle in her own,\n  She was the mild reprover of the young,\nWhenever—which means every day—they 'd shown\n  An awkward inclination to go wrong.\nThe quantity of good she did 's unknown,\n  Or at the least would lengthen out my song:\nIn brief, the little orphan of the East\nHad raised an interest in her, which increased.\n\nJuan, too, was a sort of favourite with her,\n  Because she thought him a good heart at bottom,\nA little spoil'd, but not so altogether;\n  Which was a wonder, if you think who got him,\nAnd how he had been toss'd, he scarce knew whither:\n  Though this might ruin others, it did not him,\nAt least entirely—for he had seen too many\nChanges in youth, to be surprised at any.\n\nAnd these vicissitudes tell best in youth;\n  For when they happen at a riper age,\nPeople are apt to blame the Fates, forsooth,\n  And wonder Providence is not more sage.\nAdversity is the first path to truth:\n  He who hath proved war, storm, or woman's rage,\nWhether his winters be eighteen or eighty,\nHath won the experience which is deem'd so weighty.\n\nHow far it profits is another matter.-\n  Our hero gladly saw his little charge\nSafe with a lady, whose last grown-up daughter\n  Being long married, and thus set at large,\nHad left all the accomplishments she taught her\n  To be transmitted, like the Lord Mayor's barge,\nTo the next comer; or—as it will tell\nMore Muse-like—like to Cytherea's shell.\n\nI call such things transmission; for there is\n  A floating balance of accomplishment\nWhich forms a pedigree from Miss to Miss,\n  According as their minds or backs are bent.\nSome waltz; some draw; some fathom the abyss\n  Of metaphysics; others are content\nWith music; the most moderate shine as wits;\nWhile others have a genius turn'd for fits.\n\nBut whether fits, or wits, or harpsichords,\n  Theology, fine arts, or finer stays,\nMay be the baits for gentlemen or lords\n  With regular descent, in these our days,\nThe last year to the new transfers its hoards;\n  New vestals claim men's eyes with the same praise\nOf 'elegant' et caetera, in fresh batches—\nAll matchless creatures, and yet bent on matches.\n\nBut now I will begin my poem. 'T is\n  Perhaps a little strange, if not quite new,\nThat from the first of Cantos up to this\n  I 've not begun what we have to go through.\nThese first twelve books are merely flourishes,\n  Preludios, trying just a string or two\nUpon my lyre, or making the pegs sure;\nAnd when so, you shall have the overture.\n\nMy Muses do not care a pinch of rosin\n  About what 's call'd success, or not succeeding:\nSuch thoughts are quite below the strain they have chosen;\n  'T is a 'great moral lesson' they are reading.\nI thought, at setting off, about two dozen\n  Cantos would do; but at Apollo's pleading,\nIf that my Pegasus should not be founder'd,\nI think to canter gently through a hundred.\n\nDon Juan saw that microcosm on stilts,\n  Yclept the Great World; for it is the least,\nAlthough the highest: but as swords have hilts\n  By which their power of mischief is increased,\nWhen man in battle or in quarrel tilts,\n  Thus the low world, north, south, or west, or east,\nMust still obey the high—which is their handle,\nTheir moon, their sun, their gas, their farthing candle.\n\nHe had many friends who had many wives, and was\n  Well look'd upon by both, to that extent\nOf friendship which you may accept or pass,\n  It does nor good nor harm being merely meant\nTo keep the wheels going of the higher class,\n  And draw them nightly when a ticket 's sent:\nAnd what with masquerades, and fetes, and balls,\nFor the first season such a life scarce palls.\n\nA young unmarried man, with a good name\n  And fortune, has an awkward part to play;\nFor good society is but a game,\n  'The royal game of Goose,' as I may say,\nWhere every body has some separate aim,\n  An end to answer, or a plan to lay—\nThe single ladies wishing to be double,\nThe married ones to save the virgins trouble.\n\nI don't mean this as general, but particular\n  Examples may be found of such pursuits:\nThough several also keep their perpendicular\n  Like poplars, with good principles for roots;\nYet many have a method more reticular—\n  'Fishers for men,' like sirens with soft lutes:\nFor talk six times with the same single lady,\nAnd you may get the wedding dresses ready.\n\nPerhaps you 'll have a letter from the mother,\n  To say her daughter's feelings are trepann'd;\nPerhaps you 'll have a visit from the brother,\n  All strut, and stays, and whiskers, to demand\nWhat 'your intentions are?'—One way or other\n  It seems the virgin's heart expects your hand:\nAnd between pity for her case and yours,\nYou 'll add to Matrimony's list of cures.\n\nI 've known a dozen weddings made even thus,\n  And some of them high names: I have also known\nYoung men who—though they hated to discuss\n  Pretensions which they never dream'd to have shown—\nYet neither frighten'd by a female fuss,\n  Nor by mustachios moved, were let alone,\nAnd lived, as did the broken-hearted fair,\nIn happier plight than if they form'd a pair.\n\nThere 's also nightly, to the uninitiated,\n  A peril—not indeed like love or marriage,\nBut not the less for this to be depreciated:\n  It is—I meant and mean not to disparage\nThe show of virtue even in the vitiated—\n  It adds an outward grace unto their carriage—\nBut to denounce the amphibious sort of harlot,\n'Couleur de rose,' who 's neither white nor scarlet.\n\nSuch is your cold coquette, who can't say 'No,'\n  And won't say 'Yes,' and keeps you on and off-ing\nOn a lee-shore, till it begins to blow—\n  Then sees your heart wreck'd, with an inward scoffing.\nThis works a world of sentimental woe,\n  And sends new Werters yearly to their coffin;\nBut yet is merely innocent flirtation,\nNot quite adultery, but adulteration.\n\n'Ye gods, I grow a talker!' Let us prate.\n  The next of perils, though I place it sternest,\nIs when, without regard to 'church or state,'\n  A wife makes or takes love in upright earnest.\nAbroad, such things decide few women's fate—\n  (Such, early traveller! is the truth thou learnest)—\nBut in old England, when a young bride errs,\nPoor thing! Eve's was a trifling case to hers.\n\nFor 't is a low, newspaper, humdrum, lawsuit\n  Country, where a young couple of the same ages\nCan't form a friendship, but the world o'erawes it.\n  Then there's the vulgar trick of those d��d damages! !\nA verdict—grievous foe to those who cause it!-\n  Forms a sad climax to romantic homages;\nBesides those soothing speeches of the pleaders,\nAnd evidences which regale all readers.\n\nBut they who blunder thus are raw beginners;\n  A little genial sprinkling of hypocrisy\nHas saved the fame of thousand splendid sinners,\n  The loveliest oligarchs of our gynocracy;\nYou may see such at all the balls and dinners,\n  Among the proudest of our aristocracy,\nSo gentle, charming, charitable, chaste—\nAnd all by having tact as well as taste.\n\nJuan, who did not stand in the predicament\n  Of a mere novice, had one safeguard more;\nFor he was sick—no, 't was not the word sick I meant—\n  But he had seen so much love before,\nThat he was not in heart so very weak;—I meant\n  But thus much, and no sneer against the shore\nOf white cliffs, white necks, blue eyes, bluer stockings,\nTithes, taxes, duns, and doors with double knockings.\n\nBut coming young from lands and scenes romantic,\n  Where lives, not lawsuits, must be risk'd for Passion,\nAnd Passion's self must have a spice of frantic,\n  Into a country where 't is half a fashion,\nSeem'd to him half commercial, half pedantic,\n  Howe'er he might esteem this moral nation:\nBesides (alas! his taste—forgive and pity!)\nAt first he did not think the women pretty.\n\nI say at first—for he found out at last,\n  But by degrees, that they were fairer far\nThan the more glowing dames whose lot is cast\n  Beneath the influence of the eastern star.\nA further proof we should not judge in haste;\n  Yet inexperience could not be his bar\nTo taste:—the truth is, if men would confess,\nThat novelties please less than they impress.\n\nThough travell'd, I have never had the luck to\n  Trace up those shuffling negroes, Nile or Niger,\nTo that impracticable place, Timbuctoo,\n  Where Geography finds no one to oblige her\nWith such a chart as may be safely stuck to—\n  For Europe ploughs in Afric like 'bos piger:'\nBut if I had been at Timbuctoo, there\nNo doubt I should be told that black is fair.\n\nIt is. I will not swear that black is white;\n  But I suspect in fact that white is black,\nAnd the whole matter rests upon eyesight.\n  Ask a blind man, the best judge. You 'll attack\nPerhaps this new position—but I 'm right;\n  Or if I 'm wrong, I 'll not be ta'en aback:—\nHe hath no morn nor night, but all is dark\nWithin; and what seest thou? A dubious spark.\n\nBut I 'm relapsing into metaphysics,\n  That labyrinth, whose clue is of the same\nConstruction as your cures for hectic phthisics,\n  Those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame;\nAnd this reflection brings me to plain physics,\n  And to the beauties of a foreign dame,\nCompared with those of our pure pearls of price,\nThose polar summers, all sun, and some ice.\n\nOr say they are like virtuous mermaids, whose\n  Beginnings are fair faces, ends mere fishes;—\nNot that there 's not a quantity of those\n  Who have a due respect for their own wishes.\nLike Russians rushing from hot baths to snows\n  Are they, at bottom virtuous even when vicious:\nThey warm into a scrape, but keep of course,\nAs a reserve, a plunge into remorse.\n\nBut this has nought to do with their outsides.\n  I said that Juan did not think them pretty\nAt the first blush; for a fair Briton hides\n  Half her attractions—probably from pity—\nAnd rather calmly into the heart glides,\n  Than storms it as a foe would take a city;\nBut once there (if you doubt this, prithee try)\nShe keeps it for you like a true ally.\n\nShe cannot step as does an Arab barb,\n  Or Andalusian girl from mass returning,\nNor wear as gracefully as Gauls her garb,\n  Nor in her eye Ausonia's glance is burning;\nHer voice, though sweet, is not so fit to warb—\n  le those bravuras (which I still am learning\nTo like, though I have been seven years in Italy,\nAnd have, or had, an ear that served me prettily);—\n\nShe cannot do these things, nor one or two\n  Others, in that off-hand and dashing style\nWhich takes so much—to give the devil his due;\n  Nor is she quite so ready with her smile,\nNor settles all things in one interview\n  (A thing approved as saving time and toil);—\nBut though the soil may give you time and trouble,\nWell cultivated, it will render double.\n\nAnd if in fact she takes to a 'grande passion,'\n  It is a very serious thing indeed:\nNine times in ten 't is but caprice or fashion,\n  Coquetry, or a wish to take the lead,\nThe pride of a mere child with a new sash on,\n  Or wish to make a rival's bosom bleed:\nBut the tenth instance will be a tornado,\nFor there 's no saying what they will or may do.\n\nThe reason 's obvious; if there 's an eclat,\n  They lose their caste at once, as do the Parias;\nAnd when the delicacies of the law\n  Have fill'd their papers with their comments various,\nSociety, that china without flaw\n  (The hypocrite!), will banish them like Marius,\nTo sit amidst the ruins of their guilt:\nFor Fame 's a Carthage not so soon rebuilt.\n\nPerhaps this is as it should be;—it is\n  A comment on the Gospel's 'Sin no more,\nAnd be thy sins forgiven:'—but upon this\n  I leave the saints to settle their own score.\nAbroad, though doubtless they do much amiss,\n  An erring woman finds an opener door\nFor her return to Virtue—as they cal\nThat lady, who should be at home to all.\n\nFor me, I leave the matter where I find it,\n  Knowing that such uneasy virtue leads\nPeople some ten times less in fact to mind it,\n  And care but for discoveries and not deeds.\nAnd as for chastity, you 'll never bind it\n  By all the laws the strictest lawyer pleads,\nBut aggravate the crime you have not prevented,\nBy rendering desperate those who had else repented.\n\nBut Juan was no casuist, nor had ponder'd\n  Upon the moral lessons of mankind:\nBesides, he had not seen of several hundred\n  A lady altogether to his mind.\nA little 'blase'—'t is not to be wonder'd\n  At, that his heart had got a tougher rind:\nAnd though not vainer from his past success,\nNo doubt his sensibilities were less.\n\nHe also had been busy seeing sights—\n  The Parliament and all the other houses;\nHad sat beneath the gallery at nights,\n  To hear debates whose thunder roused (not rouses)\nThe world to gaze upon those northern lights\n  Which flash'd as far as where the musk-bull browses;\nHe had also stood at times behind the throne—\nBut Grey was not arrived, and Chatham gone.\n\nHe saw, however, at the closing session,\n  That noble sight, when really free the nation,\nA king in constitutional possession\n  Of such a throne as is the proudest station,\nThough despots know it not—till the progression\n  Of freedom shall complete their education.\n'T is not mere splendour makes the show august\nTo eye or heart—it is the people's trust.\n\nThere, too, he saw (whate'er he may be now)\n  A Prince, the prince of princes at the time,\nWith fascination in his very bow,\n  And full of promise, as the spring of prime.\nThough royalty was written on his brow,\n  He had then the grace, too, rare in every clime,\nOf being, without alloy of fop or beau,\nA finish'd gentleman from top to toe.\n\nAnd Juan was received, as hath been said,\n  Into the best society: and there\nOccurr'd what often happens, I 'm afraid,\n  However disciplined and debonnaire:—\nThe talent and good humour he display'd,\n  Besides the mark'd distinction of his air,\nExposed him, as was natural, to temptation,\nEven though himself avoided the occasion.\n\nBut what, and where, with whom, and when, and why,\n  Is not to be put hastily together;\nAnd as my object is morality\n  (Whatever people say), I don't know whether\nI 'll leave a single reader's eyelid dry,\n  But harrow up his feelings till they wither,\nAnd hew out a huge monument of pathos,\nAs Philip's son proposed to do with Athos.\n\nHere the twelfth Canto of our introduction\n  Ends. When the body of the book 's begun,\nYou 'll find it of a different construction\n  From what some people say 't will be when done:\nThe plan at present 's simply in concoction,\n  I can't oblige you, reader, to read on;\nThat 's your affair, not mine: a real spirit\nShould neither court neglect, nor dread to bear it.\n\nAnd if my thunderbolt not always rattles,\n  Remember, reader! you have had before\nThe worst of tempests and the best of battles\n  That e'er were brew'd from elements or gore,\nBesides the most sublime of—Heaven knows what else:\n  An usurer could scarce expect much more—\nBut my best canto, save one on astronomy,\nWill turn upon 'political economy.'\n\nThat is your present theme for popularity:\n  Now that the public hedge hath scarce a stake,\nIt grows an act of patriotic charity,\n  To show the people the best way to break.\nMy plan (but I, if but for singularity,\n  Reserve it) will be very sure to take.\nMeantime, read all the national debt-sinkers,\nAnd tell me what you think of your great thinkers.</code>"

If I sneer sometimes,\nIt is because I cannot well do less,\n  And now and then it also suits my rhymes.\nI should be very willing to redress\n  Men's wrongs, and rather check than punish crimes,\nHad not Cervantes, in that too true tale\nOf Quixote, shown how all such efforts fail.\n\nOf all tales 't is the saddest—and more sad,\n  Because it makes us smile: his hero 's right,\nAnd still pursues the right;—to curb the bad\n  His only object, and 'gainst odds to fight\nHis guerdon: 't is his virtue makes him mad!\n  But his adventures form a sorry sight;\nA sorrier still is the great moral taught\nBy that real epic unto all who have thought.\n\nRedressing injury, revenging wrong,\n  To aid the damsel and destroy the caitiff;\nOpposing singly the united strong,\n  From foreign yoke to free the helpless native:—\nAlas! must noblest views, like an old song,\n  Be for mere fancy's sport a theme creative,\nA jest, a riddle, Fame through thin and thick sought!\nAnd Socrates himself but Wisdom's Quixote?\n\nCervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away;\n  A single laugh demolish'd the right arm\nOf his own country;—seldom since that day\n  Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,\nThe world gave ground before her bright array;\n  And therefore have his volumes done such harm,\nThat all their glory, as a composition,\nWas dearly purchased by his land's perdition.\n\nI 'm 'at my old lunes'—digression, and forget\n  The Lady Adeline Amundeville;\nThe fair most fatal Juan ever met,\n  Although she was not evil nor meant ill;\nBut Destiny and Passion spread the net\n  (Fate is a good excuse for our own will),\nAnd caught them;—what do they not catch, methinks?\nBut I 'm not OEdipus, and life 's a Sphinx.\n\nI tell the tale as it is told, nor dare\n  To venture a solution: 'Davus sum!'\nAnd now I will proceed upon the pair.\n  Sweet Adeline, amidst the gay world's hum,\nWas the Queen-Bee, the glass of all that 's fair;\n  Whose charms made all men speak, and women dumb.\nThe last 's a miracle, and such was reckon'd,\nAnd since that time there has not been a second.\n\nChaste was she, to detraction's desperation,\n  And wedded unto one she had loved well—\nA man known in the councils of the nation,\n  Cool, and quite English, imperturbable,\nThough apt to act with fire upon occasion,\n  Proud of himself and her: the world could tell\nNought against either, and both seem'd secure—\nShe in her virtue, he in his hauteur.\n\nIt chanced some diplomatical relations,\n  Arising out of business, often brought\nHimself and Juan in their mutual stations\n  Into close contact. Though reserved, nor caught\nBy specious seeming, Juan's youth, and patience,\n  And talent, on his haughty spirit wrought,\nAnd form'd a basis of esteem, which ends\nIn making men what courtesy calls friends.\n\nAnd thus Lord Henry, who was cautious as\n  Reserve and pride could make him, and full slow\nIn judging men—when once his judgment was\n  Determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,\nHad all the pertinacity pride has,\n  Which knows no ebb to its imperious flow,\nAnd loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,\nBecause its own good pleasure hath decided.\n\nHis friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,\n  Though oft well founded, which confirm'd but more\nHis prepossessions, like the laws of Persians\n  And Medes, would ne'er revoke what went before.\nHis feelings had not those strange fits, like tertians,\n  Of common likings, which make some deplore\nWhat they should laugh at—the mere ague still\nOf men's regard, the fever or the chill.\n\n''T is not in mortals to command success:\n  But do you more, Sempronius—don't deserve it,'\nAnd take my word, you won't have any less.\n  Be wary, watch the time, and always serve it;\nGive gently way, when there 's too great a press;\n  And for your conscience, only learn to nerve it,\nFor, like a racer, or a boxer training,\n'T will make, if proved, vast efforts without paining.\n\nLord Henry also liked to be superior,\n  As most men do, the little or the great;\nThe very lowest find out an inferior,\n  At least they think so, to exert their state\nUpon: for there are very few things wearier\n  Than solitary Pride's oppressive weight,\nWhich mortals generously would divide,\nBy bidding others carry while they ride.\n\nIn birth, in rank, in fortune likewise equal,\n  O'er Juan he could no distinction claim;\nIn years he had the advantage of time's sequel;\n  And, as he thought, in country much the same—\nBecause bold Britons have a tongue and free quill,\n  At which all modern nations vainly aim;\nAnd the Lord Henry was a great debater,\nSo that few members kept the house up later.\n\nThese were advantages: and then he thought—\n  It was his foible, but by no means sinister—\nThat few or none more than himself had caught\n  Court mysteries, having been himself a minister:\nHe liked to teach that which he had been taught,\n  And greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;\nAnd reconciled all qualities which grace man,\nAlways a patriot, and sometimes a placeman.\n\nHe liked the gentle Spaniard for his gravity;\n  He almost honour'd him for his docility;\nBecause, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,\n  Or contradicted but with proud humility.\nHe knew the world, and would not see depravity\n  In faults which sometimes show the soil's fertility,\nIf that the weeds o'erlive not the first crop—\nFor then they are very difficult to stop.\n\nAnd then he talk'd with him about Madrid,\n  Constantinople, and such distant places;\nWhere people always did as they were bid,\n  Or did what they should not with foreign graces.\nOf coursers also spake they: Henry rid\n  Well, like most Englishmen, and loved the races;\nAnd Juan, like a true-born Andalusian,\nCould back a horse, as despots ride a Russian.\n\nAnd thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,\n  And diplomatic dinners, or at other—\nFor Juan stood well both with Ins and Outs,\n  As in freemasonry a higher brother.\nUpon his talent Henry had no doubts;\n  His manner show'd him sprung from a high mother;\nAnd all men like to show their hospitality\nTo him whose breeding matches with his quality.\n\nAt Blank-Blank Square;—for we will break no squares\n  By naming streets: since men are so censorious,\nAnd apt to sow an author's wheat with tares,\n  Reaping allusions private and inglorious,\nWhere none were dreamt of, unto love's affairs,\n  Which were, or are, or are to be notorious,\nThat therefore do I previously declare,\nLord Henry's mansion was in Blank-Blank Square.\n\nAlso there bin another pious reason\n  For making squares and streets anonymous;\nWhich is, that there is scarce a single season\n  Which doth not shake some very splendid house\nWith some slight heart-quake of domestic treason—\n  A topic scandal doth delight to rouse:\nSuch I might stumble over unawares,\nUnless I knew the very chastest squares.\n\n'T is true, I might have chosen Piccadilly,\n  A place where peccadillos are unknown;\nBut I have motives, whether wise or silly,\n  For letting that pure sanctuary alone.\nTherefore I name not square, street, place, until I\n  Find one where nothing naughty can be shown,\nA vestal shrine of innocence of heart:\n  Such are�but I have lost the London Chart.\n\nAt Henry's mansion then, in Blank-Blank Square,\n  Was Juan a recherche, welcome guest,\nAs many other noble scions were;\n  And some who had but talent for their crest;\nOr wealth, which is a passport every where;\n  Or even mere fashion, which indeed 's the best\nRecommendation; and to be well drest\nWill very often supersede the rest.\n\nAnd since 'there 's safety in a multitude\n  Of counsellors,' as Solomon has said,\nOr some one for him, in some sage, grave mood;—\n  Indeed we see the daily proof display'd\nIn senates, at the bar, in wordy feud,\n  Where'er collective wisdom can parade,\nWhich is the only cause that we can guess\nOf Britain's present wealth and happiness;—\n\nBut as 'there 's safety' grafted in the number\n  'Of counsellors' for men, thus for the sex\nA large acquaintance lets not Virtue slumber;\n  Or should it shake, the choice will more perplex—\nVariety itself will more encumber.\n  'Midst many rocks we guard more against wrecks;\nAnd thus with women: howsoe'er it shocks some's\nSelf-love, there 's safety in a crowd of coxcombs.\n\nBut Adeline had not the least occasion\n  For such a shield, which leaves but little merit\nTo virtue proper, or good education.\n  Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,\nWhich judged mankind at their due estimation;\n  And for coquetry, she disdain'd to wear it:\nSecure of admiration, its impression\nWas faint, as of an every-day possession.\n\nTo all she was polite without parade;\n  To some she show'd attention of that kind\nWhich flatters, but is flattery convey'd\n  In such a sort as cannot leave behind\nA trace unworthy either wife or maid;—\n  A gentle, genial courtesy of mind,\nTo those who were, or pass'd for meritorious,\nJust to console sad glory for being glorious;\n\nWhich is in all respects, save now and then,\n  A dull and desolate appendage. Gaze\nUpon the shades of those distinguish'd men\n  Who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,\nThe praise of persecution; gaze again\n  On the most favour'd; and amidst the blaze\nOf sunset halos o'er the laurel-brow'd,\nWhat can ye recognise?—a gilded cloud.\n\nThere also was of course in Adeline\n  That calm patrician polish in the address,\nWhich ne'er can pass the equinoctial line\n  Of any thing which nature would express;\nJust as a mandarin finds nothing fine,—\n  At least his manner suffers not to guess\nThat any thing he views can greatly please.\nPerhaps we have borrow'd this from the Chinese—\n\nPerhaps from Horace: his 'Nil admirari'\n  Was what he call'd the 'Art of Happiness;'\nAn art on which the artists greatly vary,\n  And have not yet attain'd to much success.\nHowever, 't is expedient to be wary:\n  Indifference certes don't produce distress;\nAnd rash enthusiasm in good society\nWere nothing but a moral inebriety.\n\nBut Adeline was not indifferent: for\n  (Now for a common-place!) beneath the snow,\nAs a volcano holds the lava more\n  Within—et caetera. Shall I go on?—No!\nI hate to hunt down a tired metaphor,\n  So let the often-used volcano go.\nPoor thing! How frequently, by me and others,\nIt hath been stirr'd up till its smoke quite smothers!\n\nI 'll have another figure in a trice:—\n  What say you to a bottle of champagne?\nFrozen into a very vinous ice,\n  Which leaves few drops of that immortal rain,\nYet in the very centre, past all price,\n  About a liquid glassful will remain;\nAnd this is stronger than the strongest grape\nCould e'er express in its expanded shape:\n\n'T is the whole spirit brought to a quintessence;\n  And thus the chilliest aspects may concentre\nA hidden nectar under a cold presence.\n  And such are many—though I only meant her\nFrom whom I now deduce these moral lessons,\n  On which the Muse has always sought to enter.\nAnd your cold people are beyond all price,\nWhen once you have broken their confounded ice.\n\nBut after all they are a North-West Passage\n  Unto the glowing India of the soul;\nAnd as the good ships sent upon that message\n  Have not exactly ascertain'd the Pole\n(Though Parry's efforts look a lucky presage),\n  Thus gentlemen may run upon a shoal;\nFor if the Pole 's not open, but all frost\n(A chance still), 't is a voyage or vessel lost.\n\nAnd young beginners may as well commence\n  With quiet cruising o'er the ocean woman;\nWhile those who are not beginners should have sense\n  Enough to make for port, ere time shall summon\nWith his grey signal-flag; and the past tense,\n  The dreary 'Fuimus' of all things human,\nMust be declined, while life's thin thread 's spun out\nBetween the gaping heir and gnawing gout.\n\nBut heaven must be diverted; its diversion\n  Is sometimes truculent—but never mind:\nThe world upon the whole is worth the assertion\n  (If but for comfort) that all things are kind:\nAnd that same devilish doctrine of the Persian,\n  Of the two principles, but leaves behind\nAs many doubts as any other doctrine\nHas ever puzzled Faith withal, or yoked her in.\n\nThe English winter—ending in July,\n  To recommence in August—now was done.\n'T is the postilion's paradise: wheels fly;\n  On roads, east, south, north, west, there is a run.\nBut for post-horses who finds sympathy?\n  Man's pity 's for himself, or for his son,\nAlways premising that said son at college\nHas not contracted much more debt than knowledge.\n\nThe London winter 's ended in July—\n  Sometimes a little later. I don't err\nIn this: whatever other blunders lie\n  Upon my shoulders, here I must aver\nMy Muse a glass of weatherology;\n  For parliament is our barometer:\nLet radicals its other acts attack,\nIts sessions form our only almanack.\n\nWhen its quicksilver 's down at zero,—lo\n  Coach, chariot, luggage, baggage, equipage!\nWheels whirl from Carlton palace to Soho,\n  And happiest they who horses can engage;\nThe turnpikes glow with dust; and Rotten Row\n  Sleeps from the chivalry of this bright age;\nAnd tradesmen, with long bills and longer faces,\nSigh—as the postboys fasten on the traces.\n\nThey and their bills, 'Arcadians both,' are left\n  To the Greek kalends of another session.\nAlas! to them of ready cash bereft,\n  What hope remains? Of hope the full possession,\nOr generous draft, conceded as a gift,\n  At a long date—till they can get a fresh one—\nHawk'd about at a discount, small or large;\nAlso the solace of an overcharge.\n\nBut these are trifles. Downward flies my lord,\n  Nodding beside my lady in his carriage.\nAway! away! 'Fresh horses!' are the word,\n  And changed as quickly as hearts after marriage;\nThe obsequious landlord hath the change restored;\n  The postboys have no reason to disparage\nTheir fee; but ere the water'd wheels may hiss hence,\nThe ostler pleads too for a reminiscence.\n\n'T is granted; and the valet mounts the dickey—\n  That gentleman of lords and gentlemen;\nAlso my lady's gentlewoman, tricky,\n  Trick'd out, but modest more than poet's pen\nCan paint,—'Cosi viaggino i Ricchi!'\n  (Excuse a foreign slipslop now and then,\nIf but to show I 've travell'd; and what 's travel,\nUnless it teaches one to quote and cavil?)\n\nThe London winter and the country summer\n  Were well nigh over. 'T is perhaps a pity,\nWhen nature wears the gown that doth become her,\n  To lose those best months in a sweaty city,\nAnd wait until the nightingale grows dumber,\n  Listening debates not very wise or witty,\nEre patriots their true country can remember;—\nBut there 's no shooting (save grouse) till September.\n\nI 've done with my tirade. The world was gone;\n  The twice two thousand, for whom earth was made,\nWere vanish'd to be what they call alone—\n  That is, with thirty servants for parade,\nAs many guests, or more; before whom groan\n  As many covers, duly, daily, laid.\nLet none accuse Old England's hospitality—\nIts quantity is but condensed to quality.\n\nLord Henry and the Lady Adeline\n  Departed like the rest of their compeers,\nThe peerage, to a mansion very fine;\n  The Gothic Babel of a thousand years.\nNone than themselves could boast a longer line,\n  Where time through heroes and through beauties steers;\nAnd oaks as olden as their pedigree\nTold of their sires, a tomb in every tree.\n\nA paragraph in every paper told\n  Of their departure: such is modern fame:\n'T is pity that it takes no farther hold\n  Than an advertisement, or much the same;\nWhen, ere the ink be dry, the sound grows cold.\n  The Morning Post was foremost to proclaim—\n'Departure, for his country seat, to-day,\nLord H. Amundeville and Lady A.\n\n'We understand the splendid host intends\n  To entertain, this autumn, a select\nAnd numerous party of his noble friends;\n  'Midst whom we have heard, from sources quite correct,\n  With many more by rank and fashion deck'd;\nAlso a foreigner of high condition,\nThe envoy of the secret Russian mission.'\n\nAnd thus we see—who doubts the Morning Post?\n  (Whose articles are like the 'Thirty-nine,'\nWhich those most swear to who believe them most)—\n  Our gay Russ Spaniard was ordain'd to shine,\nDeck'd by the rays reflected from his host,\n  With those who, Pope says, 'greatly daring dine.'\n'T is odd, but true,—last war the News abounded\nMore with these dinners than the kill'd or wounded;—\n\nAs thus: 'On Thursday there was a grand dinner;\n  Present, Lords A. B. C.'—Earls, dukes, by name\nAnnounced with no less pomp than victory's winner:\n  Then underneath, and in the very same\nColumn; date, 'Falmouth. There has lately been here\n  The Slap-dash regiment, so well known to fame,\nWhose loss in the late action we regret:\nThe vacancies are fill'd up—see Gazette.'\n\nTo Norman Abbey whirl'd the noble pair,—\n  An old, old monastery once, and now\nStill older mansion; of a rich and rare\n  Mix'd Gothic, such as artists all allow\nFew specimens yet left us can compare\n  Withal: it lies perhaps a little low,\nBecause the monks preferr'd a hill behind,\nTo shelter their devotion from the wind.\n\nIt stood embosom'd in a happy valley,\n  Crown'd by high woodlands, where the Druid oak\nStood like Caractacus in act to rally\n  His host, with broad arms 'gainst the thunderstroke;\nAnd from beneath his boughs were seen to sally\n  The dappled foresters—as day awoke,\nThe branching stag swept down with all his herd,\nTo quaff a brook which murmur'd like a bird.\n\nBefore the mansion lay a lucid lake,\n  Broad as transparent, deep, and freshly fed\nBy a river, which its soften'd way did take\n  In currents through the calmer water spread\nAround: the wildfowl nestled in the brake\n  And sedges, brooding in their liquid bed:\nThe woods sloped downwards to its brink, and stood\nWith their green faces fix'd upon the flood.\n\nIts outlet dash'd into a deep cascade,\n  Sparkling with foam, until again subsiding,\nIts shriller echoes—like an infant made\n  Quiet—sank into softer ripples, gliding\nInto a rivulet; and thus allay'd,\n  Pursued its course, now gleaming, and now hiding\nIts windings through the woods; now clear, now blue,\nAccording as the skies their shadows threw.\n\nA glorious remnant of the Gothic pile\n  (While yet the church was Rome's) stood half apart\nIn a grand arch, which once screen'd many an aisle.\n  These last had disappear'd—a loss to art:\nThe first yet frown'd superbly o'er the soil,\n  And kindled feelings in the roughest heart,\nWhich mourn'd the power of time's or tempest's march,\nIn gazing on that venerable arch.\n\nWithin a niche, nigh to its pinnacle,\n  Twelve saints had once stood sanctified in stone;\nBut these had fallen, not when the friars fell,\n  But in the war which struck Charles from his throne,\nWhen each house was a fortalice, as tell\n  The annals of full many a line undone,—\nThe gallant cavaliers, who fought in vain\nFor those who knew not to resign or reign.\n\nBut in a higher niche, alone, but crowned,\n  The Virgin Mother of the God-born Child,\nWith her Son in her blessed arms, look'd round,\n  Spared by some chance when all beside was spoil'd;\nShe made the earth below seem holy ground.\n  This may be superstition, weak or wild,\nBut even the faintest relics of a shrine\nOf any worship wake some thoughts divine.\n\nA mighty window, hollow in the centre,\n  Shorn of its glass of thousand colourings,\nThrough which the deepen'd glories once could enter,\n  Streaming from off the sun like seraph's wings,\nNow yawns all desolate: now loud, now fainter,\n  The gale sweeps through its fretwork, and oft sings\nThe owl his anthem, where the silenced quire\nLie with their hallelujahs quench'd like fire.\n\nBut in the noontide of the moon, and when\n  The wind is winged from one point of heaven,\nThere moans a strange unearthly sound, which then\n  Is musical—a dying accent driven\nThrough the huge arch, which soars and sinks again.\n  Some deem it but the distant echo given\nBack to the night wind by the waterfall,\nAnd harmonised by the old choral wall:\n\nOthers, that some original shape, or form\n  Shaped by decay perchance, hath given the power\n(Though less than that of Memnon's statue, warm\n  In Egypt's rays, to harp at a fix'd hour)\nTo this grey ruin, with a voice to charm.\n  Sad, but serene, it sweeps o'er tree or tower;\nThe cause I know not, nor can solve; but such\nThe fact:—I 've heard it—once perhaps too much.\n\nAmidst the court a Gothic fountain play'd,\n  Symmetrical, but deck'd with carvings quaint—\nStrange faces, like to men in masquerade,\n  And here perhaps a monster, there a saint:\nThe spring gush'd through grim mouths of granite made,\n  And sparkled into basins, where it spent\nIts little torrent in a thousand bubbles,\nLike man's vain glory, and his vainer troubles.\n\nThe mansion's self was vast and venerable,\n  With more of the monastic than has been\nElsewhere preserved: the cloisters still were stable,\n  The cells, too, and refectory, I ween:\nAn exquisite small chapel had been able,\n  Still unimpair'd, to decorate the scene;\nThe rest had been reform'd, replaced, or sunk,\nAnd spoke more of the baron than the monk.\n\nHuge halls, long galleries, spacious chambers, join'd\n  By no quite lawful marriage of the arts,\nMight shock a connoisseur; but when combined,\n  Form'd a whole which, irregular in parts,\nYet left a grand impression on the mind,\n  At least of those whose eyes are in their hearts:\nWe gaze upon a giant for his stature,\nNor judge at first if all be true to nature.\n\nSteel barons, molten the next generation\n  To silken rows of gay and garter'd earls,\nGlanced from the walls in goodly preservation;\n  And Lady Marys blooming into girls,\nWith fair long locks, had also kept their station;\n  And countesses mature in robes and pearls:\nAlso some beauties of Sir Peter Lely,\nWhose drapery hints we may admire them freely.\n\nJudges in very formidable ermine\n  Were there, with brows that did not much invite\nThe accused to think their lordships would determine\n  His cause by leaning much from might to right:\nBishops, who had not left a single sermon:\n  Attorneys-general, awful to the sight,\nAs hinting more (unless our judgments warp us)\nOf the 'Star Chamber' than of 'Habeas Corpus.'\n\nGenerals, some all in armour, of the old\n  And iron time, ere lead had ta'en the lead;\nOthers in wigs of Marlborough's martial fold,\n  Huger than twelve of our degenerate breed:\nLordlings, with staves of white or keys of gold:\n  Nimrods, whose canvass scarce contain'd the steed;\nAnd here and there some stern high patriot stood,\nWho could not get the place for which he sued.\n\nBut ever and anon, to soothe your vision,\n  Fatigued with these hereditary glories,\nThere rose a Carlo Dolce or a Titian,\n  Or wilder group of savage Salvatore's;\nHere danced Albano's boys, and here the sea shone\n  In Vernet's ocean lights; and there the stories\nOf martyrs awed, as Spagnoletto tainted\nHis brush with all the blood of all the sainted.\n\nHere sweetly spread a landscape of Lorraine;\n  There Rembrandt made his darkness equal light,\nOr gloomy Caravaggio's gloomier stain\n  Bronzed o'er some lean and stoic anchorite:—\nBut, lo! a Teniers woos, and not in vain,\n  Your eyes to revel in a livelier sight:\nHis bell-mouth'd goblet makes me feel quite Danish\nOr Dutch with thirst—What, ho! a flask of Rhenish.\n\nO reader! if that thou canst read,—and know,\n  'T is not enough to spell, or even to read,\nTo constitute a reader; there must go\n  Virtues of which both you and I have need;—\nFirstly, begin with the beginning (though\n  That clause is hard); and secondly, proceed;\nThirdly, commence not with the end—or, sinning\nIn this sort, end at least with the beginning.\n\nBut, reader, thou hast patient been of late,\n  While I, without remorse of rhyme, or fear,\nHave built and laid out ground at such a rate,\n  Dan Phoebus takes me for an auctioneer.\nThat poets were so from their earliest date,\n  By Homer's 'Catalogue of ships' is clear;\nBut a mere modern must be moderate—\nI spare you then the furniture and plate.\n\nThe mellow autumn came, and with it came\n  The promised party, to enjoy its sweets.\nThe corn is cut, the manor full of game;\n  The pointer ranges, and the sportsman beats\nIn russet jacket:—lynx-like is his aim;\n  Full grows his bag, and wonderful his feats.\nAh, nut-brown partridges! Ah, brilliant pheasants!\nAnd ah, ye poachers!—'T is no sport for peasants.\n\nAn English autumn, though it hath no vines,\n  Blushing with Bacchant coronals along\nThe paths, o'er which the far festoon entwines\n  The red grape in the sunny lands of song,\nHath yet a purchased choice of choicest wines;\n  The claret light, and the Madeira strong.\nIf Britain mourn her bleakness, we can tell her,\nThe very best of vineyards is the cellar.\n\nThen, if she hath not that serene decline\n  Which makes the southern autumn's day appear\nAs if 't would to a second spring resign\n  The season, rather than to winter drear,\nOf in-door comforts still she hath a mine,—\n  The sea-coal fires the 'earliest of the year;'\nWithout doors, too, she may compete in mellow,\nAs what is lost in green is gain'd in yellow.\n\nAnd for the effeminate villeggiatura—\n  Rife with more horns than hounds—she hath the chase,\nSo animated that it might allure\n  Saint from his beads to join the jocund race;\nEven Nimrod's self might leave the plains of Dura,\n  And wear the Melton jacket for a space:\nIf she hath no wild boars, she hath a tame\nPreserve of bores, who ought to be made game.\n\nThe noble guests, assembled at the Abbey,\n  Consisted of—we give the sex the pas—\nThe Duchess of Fitz-Fulke; the Countess Crabby;\n  The Ladies Scilly, Busey;—Miss Eclat,\nMiss Bombazeen, Miss Mackstay, Miss O'Tabby,\n  And Mrs. Rabbi, the rich banker's squaw;\nAlso the honourable Mrs. Sleep,\nWho look'd a white lamb, yet was a black sheep:\n\nWith other Countesses of Blank—but rank;\n  At once the 'lie' and the 'elite' of crowds;\nWho pass like water filter'd in a tank,\n  All purged and pious from their native clouds;\nOr paper turn'd to money by the Bank:\n  No matter how or why, the passport shrouds\nThe 'passee' and the past; for good society\nIs no less famed for tolerance than piety,—\n\nThat is, up to a certain point; which point\n  Forms the most difficult in punctuation.\nAppearances appear to form the joint\n  On which it hinges in a higher station;\nAnd so that no explosion cry 'Aroint\n  Thee, witch!' or each Medea has her Jason;\nOr (to the point with Horace and with Pulci)\n'Omne tulit punctum, quae miscuit utile dulci.'\n\nI can't exactly trace their rule of right,\n  Which hath a little leaning to a lottery.\nI 've seen a virtuous woman put down quite\n  By the mere combination of a coterie;\nAlso a so-so matron boldly fight\n  Her way back to the world by dint of plottery,\nAnd shine the very Siria of the spheres,\nEscaping with a few slight, scarless sneers.\n\nI have seen more than I 'll say:—but we will see\n  How our villeggiatura will get on.\nThe party might consist of thirty-three\n  Of highest caste—the Brahmins of the ton.\nI have named a few, not foremost in degree,\n  But ta'en at hazard as the rhyme may run.\nBy way of sprinkling, scatter'd amongst these,\nThere also were some Irish absentees.\n\nThere was Parolles, too, the legal bully,\n  Who limits all his battles to the bar\nAnd senate: when invited elsewhere, truly,\n  He shows more appetite for words than war.\nThere was the young bard Rackrhyme, who had newly\n  Come out and glimmer'd as a six weeks' star.\nThere was Lord Pyrrho, too, the great freethinker;\nAnd Sir John Pottledeep, the mighty drinker.\n\nThere was the Duke of Dash, who was a—duke,\n  'Ay, every inch a' duke; there were twelve peers\nLike Charlemagne's—and all such peers in look\n  And intellect, that neither eyes nor ears\nFor commoners had ever them mistook.\n  There were the six Miss Rawbolds—pretty dears!\nAll song and sentiment; whose hearts were set\nLess on a convent than a coronet.\n\nThere were four Honourable Misters, whose\n  Honour was more before their names than after;\nThere was the preux Chevalier de la Ruse,\n  Whom France and Fortune lately deign'd to waft here,\nWhose chiefly harmless talent was to amuse;\n  But the clubs found it rather serious laughter,\nBecause—such was his magic power to please—\nThe dice seem'd charm'd, too, with his repartees.\n\nThere was Dick Dubious, the metaphysician,\n  Who loved philosophy and a good dinner;\nAngle, the soi-disant mathematician;\n  Sir Henry Silvercup, the great race-winner.\nThere was the Reverend Rodomont Precisian,\n  Who did not hate so much the sin as sinner;\nAnd Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet,\nGood at all things, but better at a bet.\n\nThere was jack jargon, the gigantic guardsman;\n  And General Fireface, famous in the field,\nA great tactician, and no less a swordsman,\n  Who ate, last war, more Yankees than he kill'd.\nThere was the waggish Welsh Judge, Jefferies Hardsman,\n  In his grave office so completely skill'd,\nThat when a culprit came far condemnation,\nHe had his judge's joke for consolation.\n\nGood company 's a chess-board—there are kings,\n  Queens, bishops, knights, rooks, pawns; the world 's a game;\nSave that the puppets pull at their own strings,\n  Methinks gay Punch hath something of the same.\nMy Muse, the butterfly hath but her wings,\n  Not stings, and flits through ether without aim,\nAlighting rarely:—were she but a hornet,\nPerhaps there might be vices which would mourn it.\n\nI had forgotten—but must not forget—\n  An orator, the latest of the session,\nWho had deliver'd well a very set\n  Smooth speech, his first and maidenly transgression\nUpon debate: the papers echoed yet\n  With his debut, which made a strong impression,\nAnd rank'd with what is every day display'd—\n'The best first speech that ever yet was made.'\n\nProud of his 'Hear hims!' proud, too, of his vote\n  And lost virginity of oratory,\nProud of his learning (just enough to quote),\n  He revell'd in his Ciceronian glory:\nWith memory excellent to get by rote,\n  With wit to hatch a pun or tell a story,\nGraced with some merit, and with more effrontery,\n'His country's pride,' he came down to the country.\n\nThere also were two wits by acclamation,\n  Longbow from Ireland, Strongbow from the Tweed,\nBoth lawyers and both men of education;\n  But Strongbow's wit was of more polish'd breed:\nLongbow was rich in an imagination\n  As beautiful and bounding as a steed,\nBut sometimes stumbling over a potato,—\nWhile Strongbow's best things might have come from Cato.\n\nStrongbow was like a new-tuned harpsichord;\n  But Longbow wild as an AEolian harp,\nWith which the winds of heaven can claim accord,\n  And make a music, whether flat or sharp.\nOf Strongbow's talk you would not change a word:\n  At Longbow's phrases you might sometimes carp:\nBoth wits—one born so, and the other bred—\nThis by his heart, his rival by his head.\n\nIf all these seem a heterogeneous mas\n  To be assembled at a country seat,\nYet think, a specimen of every class\n  Is better than a humdrum tete-a-tete.\nThe days of Comedy are gone, alas!\n  When Congreve's fool could vie with Moliere's bete:\nSociety is smooth'd to that excess,\nThat manners hardly differ more than dress.\n\nOur ridicules are kept in the back-ground—\n  Ridiculous enough, but also dull;\nProfessions, too, are no more to be found\n  Professional; and there is nought to cull\nOf folly's fruit; for though your fools abound,\n  They're barren, and not worth the pains to pull.\nSociety is now one polish'd horde,\nForm'd of two mighty tribes, the Bores and Bored.\n\nBut from being farmers, we turn gleaners, gleaning\n  The scanty but right-well thresh'd ears of truth;\nAnd, gentle reader! when you gather meaning,\n  You may be Boaz, and I—modest Ruth.\nFarther I 'd quote, but Scripture intervening\n  Forbids. Its great impression in my youth\nWas made by Mrs. Adams, where she cries,\n'That Scriptures out of church are blasphemies.'\n\nBut what we can we glean in this vile age\n  Of chaff, although our gleanings be not grist.\nI must not quite omit the talking sage,\n  Kit-Cat, the famous Conversationist,\nWho, in his common-place book, had a page\n  Prepared each morn for evenings. 'List, oh, list!'-\n'Alas, poor ghost!'—What unexpected woes\nAwait those who have studied their bon-mots!\n\nFirstly, they must allure the conversation\n  By many windings to their clever clinch;\nAnd secondly, must let slip no occasion,\n  Nor bate (abate) their hearers of an inch,\nBut take an ell—and make a great sensation,\n  If possible; and thirdly, never flinch\nWhen some smart talker puts them to the test,\nBut seize the last word, which no doubt 's the best.\n\nLord Henry and his lady were the hosts;\n  The party we have touch'd on were the guests:\nTheir table was a board to tempt even ghosts\n  To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.\nI will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts,\n  Albeit all human history attests\nThat happiness for man—the hungry sinner!-\nSince Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.\n\nWitness the lands which 'flow'd with milk and honey,'\n  Held out unto the hungry Israelites;\nTo this we have added since, the love of money,\n  The only sort of pleasure which requites.\nYouth fades, and leaves our days no longer sunny;\n  We tire of mistresses and parasites;\nBut oh, ambrosial cash! Ah! who would lose thee?\nWhen we no more can use, or even abuse thee!\n\nThe gentlemen got up betimes to shoot,\n  Or hunt: the young, because they liked the sport—\nThe first thing boys like after play and fruit;\n  The middle-aged to make the day more short;\nFor ennui is a growth of English root,\n  Though nameless in our language:—we retort\nThe fact for words, and let the French translate\nThat awful yawn which sleep can not abate.\n\nThe elderly walk'd through the library,\n  And tumbled books, or criticised the pictures,\nOr saunter'd through the gardens piteously,\n  And made upon the hot-house several strictures,\nOr rode a nag which trotted not too high,\n  Or on the morning papers read their lectures,\nOr on the watch their longing eyes would fix,\nLonging at sixty for the hour of six.\n\nBut none were 'gene:' the great hour of union\n  Was rung by dinner's knell; till then all were\nMasters of their own time—or in communion,\n  Or solitary, as they chose to bear\nThe hours, which how to pass is but to few known.\n  Each rose up at his own, and had to spare\nWhat time he chose for dress, and broke his fast\nWhen, where, and how he chose for that repast.\n\nThe ladies—some rouged, some a little pale—\n  Met the morn as they might. If fine, they rode,\nOr walk'd; if foul, they read, or told a tale,\n  Sung, or rehearsed the last dance from abroad;\nDiscuss'd the fashion which might next prevail,\n  And settled bonnets by the newest code,\nOr cramm'd twelve sheets into one little letter,\nTo make each correspondent a new debtor.\n\nFor some had absent lovers, all had friends.\n  The earth has nothing like a she epistle,\nAnd hardly heaven—because it never ends.\n  I love the mystery of a female missal,\nWhich, like a creed, ne'er says all it intends,\n  But full of cunning as Ulysses' whistle,\nWhen he allured poor Dolon:—you had better\nTake care what you reply to such a letter.\n\nThen there were billiards; cards, too, but no dice;—\n  Save in the clubs no man of honour plays;—\nBoats when 't was water, skating when 't was ice,\n  And the hard frost destroy'd the scenting days:\nAnd angling, too, that solitary vice,\n  Whatever Izaak Walton sings or says;\nThe quaint, old, cruel coxcomb, in his gullet\nShould have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.\n\nWith evening came the banquet and the wine;\n  The conversazione; the duet,\nAttuned by voices more or less divine\n  (My heart or head aches with the memory yet).\nThe four Miss Rawbolds in a glee would shine;\n  But the two youngest loved more to be set\nDown to the harp—because to music's charms\nThey added graceful necks, white hands and arms.\n\nSometimes a dance (though rarely on field days,\n  For then the gentlemen were rather tired)\nDisplay'd some sylph-like figures in its maze;\n  Then there was small-talk ready when required;\nFlirtation—but decorous; the mere praise\n  Of charms that should or should not be admired.\nThe hunters fought their fox-hunt o'er again,\nAnd then retreated soberly—at ten.\n\nThe politicians, in a nook apart,\n  Discuss'd the world, and settled all the spheres;\nThe wits watch'd every loophole for their art,\n  To introduce a bon-mot head and ears;\nSmall is the rest of those who would be smart,\n  A moment's good thing may have cost them years\nBefore they find an hour to introduce it;\nAnd then, even then, some bore may make them lose it.\n\nBut all was gentle and aristocratic\n  In this our party; polish'd, smooth, and cold,\nAs Phidian forms cut out of marble Attic.\n  There now are no Squire Westerns as of old;\nAnd our Sophias are not so emphatic,\n  But fair as then, or fairer to behold.\nWe have no accomplish'd blackguards, like Tom Jones,\nBut gentlemen in stays, as stiff as stones.\n\nThey separated at an early hour;\n  That is, ere midnight—which is London's noon:\nBut in the country ladies seek their bower\n  A little earlier than the waning moon.\nPeace to the slumbers of each folded flower—\n  May the rose call back its true colour soon!\nGood hours of fair cheeks are the fairest tinters,\nAnd lower the price of rouge—at least some winters.</code>"

Pray tell me, can you make fast,\n  After due search, your faith to any question?\nLook back o'er ages, ere unto the stake fast\n  You bind yourself, and call some mode the best one.\nNothing more true than not to trust your senses;\nAnd yet what are your other evidences?\n\nFor me, I know nought; nothing I deny,\n  Admit, reject, contemn; and what know you,\nExcept perhaps that you were born to die?\n  And both may after all turn out untrue.\nAn age may come, Font of Eternity,\n  When nothing shall be either old or new.\nDeath, so call'd, is a thing which makes men weep,\nAnd yet a third of life is pass'd in sleep.\n\nA sleep without dreams, after a rough day\n  Of toil, is what we covet most; and yet\nHow clay shrinks back from more quiescent clay!\n  The very Suicide that pays his debt\nAt once without instalments (an old way\n  Of paying debts, which creditors regret)\nLets out impatiently his rushing breath,\nLess from disgust of life than dread of death.\n\n'T is round him, near him, here, there, every where;\n  And there 's a courage which grows out of fear,\nPerhaps of all most desperate, which will dare\n  The worst to know it:—when the mountains rear\nTheir peaks beneath your human foot, and there\n  You look down o'er the precipice, and drear\nThe gulf of rock yawns,—you can't gaze a minute\nWithout an awful wish to plunge within it.\n\n'T is true, you don't—but, pale and struck with terror,\n  Retire: but look into your past impression!\nAnd you will find, though shuddering at the mirror\n  Of your own thoughts, in all their self-confession,\nThe lurking bias, be it truth or error,\n  To the unknown; a secret prepossession,\nTo plunge with all your fears—but where? You know not,\nAnd that's the reason why you do—or do not.\n\nBut what 's this to the purpose? you will say.\n  Gent. reader, nothing; a mere speculation,\nFor which my sole excuse is—'t is my way;\n  Sometimes with and sometimes without occasion\nI write what 's uppermost, without delay:\n  This narrative is not meant for narration,\nBut a mere airy and fantastic basis,\nTo build up common things with common places.\n\nYou know, or don't know, that great Bacon saith,\n  'Fling up a straw, 't will show the way the wind blows;'\nAnd such a straw, borne on by human breath,\n  Is poesy, according as the mind glows;\nA paper kite which flies 'twixt life and death,\n  A shadow which the onward soul behind throws:\nAnd mine 's a bubble, not blown up for praise,\nBut just to play with, as an infant plays.\n\nThe world is all before me—or behind;\n  For I have seen a portion of that same,\nAnd quite enough for me to keep in mind;—\n  Of passions, too, I have proved enough to blame,\nTo the great pleasure of our friends, mankind,\n  Who like to mix some slight alloy with fame;\nFor I was rather famous in my time,\nUntil I fairly knock'd it up with rhyme.\n\nI have brought this world about my ears, and eke\n  The other; that 's to say, the clergy, who\nUpon my head have bid their thunders break\n  In pious libels by no means a few.\nAnd yet I can't help scribbling once a week,\n  Tiring old readers, nor discovering new.\nIn youth I wrote because my mind was full,\nAnd now because I feel it growing dull.\n\nBut 'why then publish?'—There are no rewards\n  Of fame or profit when the world grows weary.\nI ask in turn,—Why do you play at cards?\n  Why drink? Why read?—To make some hour less dreary.\nIt occupies me to turn back regards\n  On what I 've seen or ponder'd, sad or cheery;\nAnd what I write I cast upon the stream,\nTo swim or sink—I have had at least my dream.\n\nI think that were I certain of success,\n  I hardly could compose another line:\nSo long I 've battled either more or less,\n  That no defeat can drive me from the Nine.\nThis feeling 't is not easy to express,\n  And yet 't is not affected, I opine.\nIn play, there are two pleasures for your choosing—\nThe one is winning, and the other losing.\n\nBesides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:\n  She gathers a repertory of facts,\nOf course with some reserve and slight restriction,\n  But mostly sings of human things and acts—\nAnd that 's one cause she meets with contradiction;\n  For too much truth, at first sight, ne'er attracts;\nAnd were her object only what 's call'd glory,\nWith more ease too she 'd tell a different story.\n\nLove, war, a tempest—surely there 's variety;\n  Also a seasoning slight of lucubration;\nA bird's-eye view, too, of that wild, Society;\n  A slight glance thrown on men of every station.\nIf you have nought else, here 's at least satiety\n  Both in performance and in preparation;\nAnd though these lines should only line portmanteaus,\nTrade will be all the better for these Cantos.\n\nThe portion of this world which I at present\n  Have taken up to fill the following sermon,\nIs one of which there 's no description recent.\n  The reason why is easy to determine:\nAlthough it seems both prominent and pleasant,\n  There is a sameness in its gems and ermine,\nA dull and family likeness through all ages,\nOf no great promise for poetic pages.\n\nWith much to excite, there 's little to exalt;\n  Nothing that speaks to all men and all times;\nA sort of varnish over every fault;\n  A kind of common-place, even in their crimes;\nFactitious passions, wit without much salt,\n  A want of that true nature which sublimes\nWhate'er it shows with truth; a smooth monotony\nOf character, in those at least who have got any.\n\nSometimes, indeed, like soldiers off parade,\n  They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;\nBut then the roll-call draws them back afraid,\n  And they must be or seem what they were: still\nDoubtless it is a brilliant masquerade;\n  But when of the first sight you have had your fill,\nIt palls—at least it did so upon me,\nThis paradise of pleasure and ennui.\n\nWhen we have made our love, and gamed our gaming,\n  Drest, voted, shone, and, may be, something more;\nWith dandies dined; heard senators declaiming;\n  Seen beauties brought to market by the score,\nSad rakes to sadder husbands chastely taming;\n  There 's little left but to be bored or bore.\nWitness those 'ci-devant jeunes hommes' who stem\nThe stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.\n\n'T is said—indeed a general complaint—\n  That no one has succeeded in describing\nThe monde, exactly as they ought to paint:\n  Some say, that authors only snatch, by bribing\nThe porter, some slight scandals strange and quaint,\n  To furnish matter for their moral gibing;\nAnd that their books have but one style in common—\nMy lady's prattle, filter'd through her woman.\n\nBut this can't well be true, just now; for writers\n  Are grown of the beau monde a part potential:\nI 've seen them balance even the scale with fighters,\n  Especially when young, for that 's essential.\nWhy do their sketches fail them as inditers\n  Of what they deem themselves most consequential,\nThe real portrait of the highest tribe?\n'T is that, in fact, there 's little to describe.\n\n'Haud ignara loquor;' these are Nugae, 'quarum\n  Pars parva fui,' but still art and part.\nNow I could much more easily sketch a harem,\n  A battle, wreck, or history of the heart,\nThan these things; and besides, I wish to spare 'em,\n  For reasons which I choose to keep apart.\n'Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgarit—'\nWhich means that vulgar people must not share it.\n\nAnd therefore what I throw off is ideal—\n  Lower'd, leaven'd, like a history of freemasons;\nWhich bears the same relation to the real,\n  As Captain Parry's voyage may do to Jason's.\nThe grand arcanum 's not for men to see all;\n  My music has some mystic diapasons;\nAnd there is much which could not be appreciated\nIn any manner by the uninitiated.\n\nAlas! worlds fall—and woman, since she fell'd\n  The world (as, since that history less polite\nThan true, hath been a creed so strictly held)\n  Has not yet given up the practice quite.\nPoor thing of usages! coerced, compell'd,\n  Victim when wrong, and martyr oft when right,\nCondemn'd to child-bed, as men for their sins\nHave shaving too entail'd upon their chins,—\n\nA daily plague, which in the aggregate\n  May average on the whole with parturition.\nBut as to women, who can penetrate\n  The real sufferings of their she condition?\nMan's very sympathy with their estate\n  Has much of selfishness, and more suspicion.\nTheir love, their virtue, beauty, education,\nBut form good housekeepers, to breed a nation.\n\nAll this were very well, and can't be better;\n  But even this is difficult, Heaven knows,\nSo many troubles from her birth beset her,\n  Such small distinction between friends and foes,\nThe gilding wears so soon from off her fetter,\n  That—but ask any woman if she'd choose\n(Take her at thirty, that is) to have been\nFemale or male? a schoolboy or a queen?\n\n'Petticoat influence' is a great reproach,\n  Which even those who obey would fain be thought\nTo fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach;\n  But since beneath it upon earth we are brought,\nBy various joltings of life's hackney coach,\n  I for one venerate a petticoat—\nA garment of a mystical sublimity,\nNo matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.\n\nMuch I respect, and much I have adored,\n  In my young days, that chaste and goodly veil,\nWhich holds a treasure, like a miser's hoard,\n  And more attracts by all it doth conceal—\nA golden scabbard on a Damasque sword,\n  A loving letter with a mystic seal,\nA cure for grief—for what can ever rankle\nBefore a petticoat and peeping ankle?\n\nAnd when upon a silent, sullen day,\n  With a sirocco, for example, blowing,\nWhen even the sea looks dim with all its spray,\n  And sulkily the river's ripple 's flowing,\nAnd the sky shows that very ancient gray,\n  The sober, sad antithesis to glowing,—\n'T is pleasant, if then any thing is pleasant,\nTo catch a glimpse even of a pretty peasant.\n\nWe left our heroes and our heroines\n  In that fair clime which don't depend on climate,\nQuite independent of the Zodiac's signs,\n  Though certainly more difficult to rhyme at,\nBecause the sun, and stars, and aught that shines,\n  Mountains, and all we can be most sublime at,\nAre there oft dull and dreary as a dun—\nWhether a sky's or tradesman's is all one.\n\nAn in-door life is less poetical;\n  And out of door hath showers, and mists, and sleet,\nWith which I could not brew a pastoral.\n  But be it as it may, a bard must meet\nAll difficulties, whether great or small,\n  To spoil his undertaking or complete,\nAnd work away like spirit upon matter,\nEmbarrass'd somewhat both with fire and water.\n\nJuan—in this respect, at least, like saints—\n  Was all things unto people of all sorts,\nAnd lived contentedly, without complaints,\n  In camps, in ships, in cottages, or courts—\nBorn with that happy soul which seldom faints,\n  And mingling modestly in toils or sports.\nHe likewise could be most things to all women,\nWithout the coxcombry of certain she men.\n\nA fox-hunt to a foreigner is strange;\n  'T is also subject to the double danger\nOf tumbling first, and having in exchange\n  Some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:\nBut Juan had been early taught to range\n  The wilds, as doth an Arab turn'd avenger,\nSo that his horse, or charger, hunter, hack,\nKnew that he had a rider on his back.\n\nAnd now in this new field, with some applause,\n  He clear'd hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,\nAnd never craned, and made but few 'faux pas,'\n  And only fretted when the scent 'gan fail.\nHe broke, 't is true, some statutes of the laws\n  Of hunting—for the sagest youth is frail;\nRode o'er the hounds, it may be, now and then,\nAnd once o'er several country gentlemen.\n\nBut on the whole, to general admiration\n  He acquitted both himself and horse: the squires\nMarvell'd at merit of another nation;\n  The boors cried 'Dang it? who 'd have thought it?'—Sires,\nThe Nestors of the sporting generation,\n  Swore praises, and recall'd their former fires;\nThe huntsman's self relented to a grin,\nAnd rated him almost a whipper-in.\n\nSuch were his trophies—not of spear and shield,\n  But leaps, and bursts, and sometimes foxes' brushes;\nYet I must own,—although in this I yield\n  To patriot sympathy a Briton's blushes,—\nHe thought at heart like courtly Chesterfield,\n  Who, after a long chase o'er hills, dales, bushes,\nAnd what not, though he rode beyond all price,\nAsk'd next day, 'If men ever hunted twice?'\n\nHe also had a quality uncommon\n  To early risers after a long chase,\nWho wake in winter ere the cock can summon\n  December's drowsy day to his dull race,—\nA quality agreeable to woman,\n  When her soft, liquid words run on apace,\nWho likes a listener, whether saint or sinner,—\nHe did not fall asleep just after dinner;\n\nBut, light and airy, stood on the alert,\n  And shone in the best part of dialogue,\nBy humouring always what they might assert,\n  And listening to the topics most in vogue;\nNow grave, now gay, but never dull or pert;\n  And smiling but in secret—cunning rogue!\nHe ne'er presumed to make an error clearer;—\nIn short, there never was a better hearer.\n\nAnd then he danced;—all foreigners excel\n  The serious Angles in the eloquence\nOf pantomime;—he danced, I say, right well,\n  With emphasis, and also with good sense—\nA thing in footing indispensable;\n  He danced without theatrical pretence,\nNot like a ballet-master in the van\nOf his drill'd nymphs, but like a gentleman.\n\nChaste were his steps, each kept within due bound,\n  And elegance was sprinkled o'er his figure;\nLike swift Camilla, he scarce skimm'd the ground,\n  And rather held in than put forth his vigour;\nAnd then he had an ear for music's sound,\n  Which might defy a crotchet critic's rigour.\nSuch classic pas—sans flaws—set off our hero,\nHe glanced like a personified Bolero;\n\nOr, like a flying Hour before Aurora,\n  In Guido's famous fresco which alone\nIs worth a tour to Rome, although no more a\n  Remnant were there of the old world's sole throne.\nThe 'tout ensemble' of his movements wore a\n  Grace of the soft ideal, seldom shown,\nAnd ne'er to be described; for to the dolour\nOf bards and prosers, words are void of colour.\n\nNo marvel then he was a favourite;\n  A full-grown Cupid, very much admired;\nA little spoilt, but by no means so quite;\n  At least he kept his vanity retired.\nSuch was his tact, he could alike delight\n  The chaste, and those who are not so much inspired.\nThe Duchess of Fitz-Fulke, who loved 'tracasserie,'\nBegan to treat him with some small 'agacerie.'\n\nShe was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,\n  Desirable, distinguish'd, celebrated\nFor several winters in the grand, grand monde.\n  I 'd rather not say what might be related\nOf her exploits, for this were ticklish ground;\n  Besides there might be falsehood in what 's stated:\nHer late performance had been a dead set\nAt Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.\n\nThis noble personage began to look\n  A little black upon this new flirtation;\nBut such small licences must lovers brook,\n  Mere freedoms of the female corporation.\nWoe to the man who ventures a rebuke!\n  'T will but precipitate a situation\nExtremely disagreeable, but common\nTo calculators when they count on woman.\n\nThe circle smiled, then whisper'd, and then sneer'd;\n  The Misses bridled, and the matrons frown'd;\nSome hoped things might not turn out as they fear'd;\n  Some would not deem such women could be found;\nSome ne'er believed one half of what they heard;\n  Some look'd perplex'd, and others look'd profound;\nAnd several pitied with sincere regret\nPoor Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.\n\nBut what is odd, none ever named the duke,\n  Who, one might think, was something in the affair;\nTrue, he was absent, and, 't was rumour'd, took\n  But small concern about the when, or where,\nOr what his consort did: if he could brook\n  Her gaieties, none had a right to stare:\nTheirs was that best of unions, past all doubt,\nWhich never meets, and therefore can't fall out.\n\nBut, oh! that I should ever pen so sad a line!\n  Fired with an abstract love of virtue, she,\nMy Dian of the Ephesians, Lady Adeline,\n  Began to think the duchess' conduct free;\nRegretting much that she had chosen so bad a line,\n  And waxing chiller in her courtesy,\nLook'd grave and pale to see her friend's fragility,\nFor which most friends reserve their sensibility.\n\nThere 's nought in this bad world like sympathy:\n  'T is so becoming to the soul and face,\nSets to soft music the harmonious sigh,\n  And robes sweet friendship in a Brussels lace.\nWithout a friend, what were humanity,\n  To hunt our errors up with a good grace?\nConsoling us with—'Would you had thought twice!\nAh, if you had but follow'd my advice!'\n\nO job! you had two friends: one 's quite enough,\n  Especially when we are ill at ease;\nThey are but bad pilots when the weather 's rough,\n  Doctors less famous for their cures than fees.\nLet no man grumble when his friends fall off,\n  As they will do like leaves at the first breeze:\nWhen your affairs come round, one way or t' other,\nGo to the coffee-house, and take another.\n\nBut this is not my maxim: had it been,\n  Some heart-aches had been spared me: yet I care not—\nI would not be a tortoise in his screen\n  Of stubborn shell, which waves and weather wear not.\n'T is better on the whole to have felt and seen\n  That which humanity may bear, or bear not:\n'T will teach discernment to the sensitive,\nAnd not to pour their ocean in a sieve.\n\nOf all the horrid, hideous notes of woe,\n  Sadder than owl-songs or the midnight blast,\nIs that portentous phrase, 'I told you so,'\n  Utter'd by friends, those prophets of the past,\nWho, 'stead of saying what you now should do,\n  Own they foresaw that you would fall at last,\nAnd solace your slight lapse 'gainst 'bonos mores,'\nWith a long memorandum of old stories.\n\nThe Lady Adeline's serene severity\n  Was not confined to feeling for her friend,\nWhose fame she rather doubted with posterity,\n  Unless her habits should begin to mend:\nBut Juan also shared in her austerity,\n  But mix'd with pity, pure as e'er was penn'd:\nHis inexperience moved her gentle ruth,\nAnd (as her junior by six weeks) his youth.\n\nThese forty days' advantage of her years—\n  And hers were those which can face calculation,\nBoldly referring to the list of peers\n  And noble births, nor dread the enumeration—\nGave her a right to have maternal fears\n  For a young gentleman's fit education,\nThough she was far from that leap year, whose leap,\nIn female dates, strikes Time all of a heap.\n\nThis may be fix'd at somewhere before thirty—\n  Say seven-and-twenty; for I never knew\nThe strictest in chronology and virtue\n  Advance beyond, while they could pass for new.\nO Time! why dost not pause? Thy scythe, so dirty\n  With rust, should surely cease to hack and hew.\nReset it; shave more smoothly, also slower,\nIf but to keep thy credit as a mower.\n\nBut Adeline was far from that ripe age,\n  Whose ripeness is but bitter at the best:\n'T was rather her experience made her sage,\n  For she had seen the world and stood its test,\nAs I have said in—I forget what page;\n  My Muse despises reference, as you have guess'd\nBy this time;—but strike six from seven-and-twenty,\nAnd you will find her sum of years in plenty.\n\nAt sixteen she came out; presented, vaunted,\n  She put all coronets into commotion:\nAt seventeen, too, the world was still enchanted\n  With the new Venus of their brilliant ocean:\nAt eighteen, though below her feet still panted\n  A hecatomb of suitors with devotion,\nShe had consented to create again\nThat Adam, call'd 'The happiest of men.'\n\nSince then she had sparkled through three glowing winters,\n  Admired, adored; but also so correct,\nThat she had puzzled all the acutest hinters,\n  Without the apparel of being circumspect:\nThey could not even glean the slightest splinters\n  From off the marble, which had no defect.\nShe had also snatch'd a moment since her marriage\nTo bear a son and heir—and one miscarriage.\n\nFondly the wheeling fire-flies flew around her,\n  Those little glitterers of the London night;\nBut none of these possess'd a sting to wound her—\n  She was a pitch beyond a coxcomb's flight.\nPerhaps she wish'd an aspirant profounder;\n  But whatsoe'er she wish'd, she acted right;\nAnd whether coldness, pride, or virtue dignify\nA woman, so she 's good, what does it signify?\n\nI hate a motive, like a lingering bottle\n  Which with the landlord makes too long a stand,\nLeaving all-claretless the unmoisten'd throttle,\n  Especially with politics on hand;\nI hate it, as I hate a drove of cattle,\n  Who whirl the dust as simooms whirl the sand;\nI hate it, as I hate an argument,\nA laureate's ode, or servile peer's 'content.'\n\n'T is sad to hack into the roots of things,\n  They are so much intertwisted with the earth;\nSo that the branch a goodly verdure flings,\n  I reck not if an acorn gave it birth.\nTo trace all actions to their secret springs\n  Would make indeed some melancholy mirth;\nBut this is not at present my concern,\nAnd I refer you to wise Oxenstiern.\n\nWith the kind view of saving an eclat,\n  Both to the duchess and diplomatist,\nThe Lady Adeline, as soon 's she saw\n  That Juan was unlikely to resist\n(For foreigners don't know that a faux pas\n  In England ranks quite on a different list\nFrom those of other lands unblest with juries,\nWhose verdict for such sin a certain cure is);—\n\nThe Lady Adeline resolved to take\n  Such measures as she thought might best impede\nThe farther progress of this sad mistake.\n  She thought with some simplicity indeed;\nBut innocence is bold even at the stake,\n  And simple in the world, and doth not need\nNor use those palisades by dames erected,\nWhose virtue lies in never being detected.\n\nIt was not that she fear'd the very worst:\n  His Grace was an enduring, married man,\nAnd was not likely all at once to burst\n  Into a scene, and swell the clients' clan\nOf Doctors' Commons: but she dreaded first\n  The magic of her Grace's talisman,\nAnd next a quarrel (as he seem'd to fret)\nWith Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.\n\nHer Grace, too, pass'd for being an intrigante,\n  And somewhat mechante in her amorous sphere;\nOne of those pretty, precious plagues, which haunt\n  A lover with caprices soft and dear,\nThat like to make a quarrel, when they can't\n  Find one, each day of the delightful year;\nBewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,\nAnd—what is worst of all—won't let you go:\n\nThe sort of thing to turn a young man's head,\n  Or make a Werter of him in the end.\nNo wonder then a purer soul should dread\n  This sort of chaste liaison for a friend;\nIt were much better to be wed or dead,\n  Than wear a heart a woman loves to rend.\n'T is best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,\nIf that a 'bonne fortune' be really 'bonne.'\n\nAnd first, in the o'erflowing of her heart,\n  Which really knew or thought it knew no guile,\nShe call'd her husband now and then apart,\n  And bade him counsel Juan. With a smile\nLord Henry heard her plans of artless art\n  To wean Don Juan from the siren's wile;\nAnd answer'd, like a statesman or a prophet,\nIn such guise that she could make nothing of it.\n\nFirstly, he said, 'he never interfered\n  In any body's business but the king's:'\nNext, that 'he never judged from what appear'd,\n  Without strong reason, of those sort of things:'\nThirdly, that 'Juan had more brain than beard,\n  And was not to be held in leading strings;'\nAnd fourthly, what need hardly be said twice,\n'That good but rarely came from good advice.'\n\nAnd, therefore, doubtless to approve the truth\n  Of the last axiom, he advised his spouse\nTo leave the parties to themselves, forsooth—\n  At least as far as bienseance allows:\nThat time would temper Juan's faults of youth;\n  That young men rarely made monastic vows;\nThat opposition only more attaches—\nBut here a messenger brought in despatches:\n\nAnd being of the council call'd 'the Privy,'\n  Lord Henry walk'd into his cabinet,\nTo furnish matter for some future Livy\n  To tell how he reduced the nation's debt;\nAnd if their full contents I do not give ye,\n  It is because I do not know them yet;\nBut I shall add them in a brief appendix,\nTo come between mine epic and its index.\n\nBut ere he went, he added a slight hint,\n  Another gentle common-place or two,\nSuch as are coin'd in conversation's mint,\n  And pass, for want of better, though not new:\nThen broke his packet, to see what was in 't,\n  And having casually glanced it through,\nRetired; and, as went out, calmly kiss'd her,\nLess like a young wife than an aged sister.\n\nHe was a cold, good, honourable man,\n  Proud of his birth, and proud of every thing;\nA goodly spirit for a state divan,\n  A figure fit to walk before a king;\nTall, stately, form'd to lead the courtly van\n  On birthdays, glorious with a star and string;\nThe very model of a chamberlain—\nAnd such I mean to make him when I reign.\n\nBut there was something wanting on the whole—\n  I don't know what, and therefore cannot tell—\nWhich pretty women—the sweet souls!—call soul.\n  Certes it was not body; he was well\nProportion'd, as a poplar or a pole,\n  A handsome man, that human miracle;\nAnd in each circumstance of love or war\nHad still preserved his perpendicular.\n\nStill there was something wanting, as I 've said—\n  That undefinable 'Je ne scais quoi,'\nWhich, for what I know, may of yore have led\n  To Homer's Iliad, since it drew to Troy\nThe Greek Eve, Helen, from the Spartan's bed;\n  Though on the whole, no doubt, the Dardan boy\nWas much inferior to King Menelaus:—\nBut thus it is some women will betray us.\n\nThere is an awkward thing which much perplexes,\n  Unless like wise Tiresias we had proved\nBy turns the difference of the several sexes;\n  Neither can show quite how they would be loved.\nThe sensual for a short time but connects us,\n  The sentimental boasts to be unmoved;\nBut both together form a kind of centaur,\nUpon whose back 't is better not to venture.\n\nA something all-sufficient for the heart\n  Is that for which the sex are always seeking:\nBut how to fill up that same vacant part?\n  There lies the rub—and this they are but weak in.\nFrail mariners afloat without a chart,\n  They run before the wind through high seas breaking;\nAnd when they have made the shore through every shock,\n'T is odd, or odds, it may turn out a rock.\n\nThere is a flower call'd 'Love in Idleness,'\n  For which see Shakspeare's everblooming garden;—\nI will not make his great description less,\n  And beg his British godship's humble pardon,\nIf in my extremity of rhyme's distress,\n  I touch a single leaf where he is warden;—\nBut though the flower is different, with the French\nOr Swiss Rousseau, cry 'Voila la Pervenche!'\n\nEureka! I have found it! What I mean\n  To say is, not that love is idleness,\nBut that in love such idleness has been\n  An accessory, as I have cause to guess.\nHard labour's an indifferent go-between;\n  Your men of business are not apt to express\nMuch passion, since the merchant-ship, the Argo,\nConvey'd Medea as her supercargo.\n\n'Beatus ille procul!' from 'negotiis,'\n  Saith Horace; the great little poet 's wrong;\nHis other maxim, 'Noscitur a sociis,'\n  Is much more to the purpose of his song;\nThough even that were sometimes too ferocious,\n  Unless good company be kept too long;\nBut, in his teeth, whate'er their state or station,\nThrice happy they who have an occupation!\n\nAdam exchanged his Paradise for ploughing,\n  Eve made up millinery with fig leaves—\nThe earliest knowledge from the tree so knowing,\n  As far as I know, that the church receives:\nAnd since that time it need not cost much showing,\n  That many of the ills o'er which man grieves,\nAnd still more women, spring from not employing\nSome hours to make the remnant worth enjoying.\n\nAnd hence high life is oft a dreary void,\n  A rack of pleasures, where we must invent\nA something wherewithal to be annoy'd.\n  Bards may sing what they please about Content;\nContented, when translated, means but cloy'd;\n  And hence arise the woes of sentiment,\nBlue devils, and blue-stockings, and romances\nReduced to practice, and perform'd like dances.\n\nI do declare, upon an affidavit,\n  Romances I ne'er read like those I have seen;\nNor, if unto the world I ever gave it,\n  Would some believe that such a tale had been:\nBut such intent I never had, nor have it;\n  Some truths are better kept behind a screen,\nEspecially when they would look like lies;\nI therefore deal in generalities.\n\n'An oyster may be cross'd in love,'—and why?\n  Because he mopeth idly in his shell,\nAnd heaves a lonely subterraqueous sigh,\n  Much as a monk may do within his cell:\nAnd a-propos of monks, their piety\n  With sloth hath found it difficult to dwell;\nThose vegetables of the Catholic creed\nAre apt exceedingly to run to seed.\n\nO Wilberforce! thou man of black renown,\n  Whose merit none enough can sing or say,\nThou hast struck one immense Colossus down,\n  Thou moral Washington of Africa!\nBut there 's another little thing, I own,\n  Which you should perpetrate some summer's day,\nAnd set the other halt of earth to rights;\nYou have freed the blacks—now pray shut up the whites.\n\nShut up the bald-coot bully Alexander!\n  Ship off the Holy Three to Senegal;\nTeach them that 'sauce for goose is sauce for gander,'\n  And ask them how they like to be in thrall?\nShut up each high heroic salamander,\n  Who eats fire gratis (since the pay 's but small);\nShut up—no, not the King, but the Pavilion,\nOr else 't will cost us all another million.\n\nShut up the world at large, let Bedlam out;\n  And you will be perhaps surprised to find\nAll things pursue exactly the same route,\n  As now with those of soi-disant sound mind.\nThis I could prove beyond a single doubt,\n  Were there a jot of sense among mankind;\nBut till that point d'appui is found, alas!\nLike Archimedes, I leave earth as 't was.\n\nOur gentle Adeline had one defect—\n  Her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;\nHer conduct had been perfectly correct,\n  As she had seen nought claiming its expansion.\nA wavering spirit may be easier wreck'd,\n  Because 't is frailer, doubtless, than a stanch one;\nBut when the latter works its own undoing,\nIts inner crash is like an earthquake's ruin.\n\nShe loved her lord, or thought so; but that love\n  Cost her an effort, which is a sad toil,\nThe stone of Sisyphus, if once we move\n  Our feelings 'gainst the nature of the soil.\nShe had nothing to complain of, or reprove,\n  No bickerings, no connubial turmoil:\nTheir union was a model to behold,\nSerene and noble,—conjugal, but cold.\n\nThere was no great disparity of years,\n  Though much in temper; but they never clash'd:\nThey moved like stars united in their spheres,\n  Or like the Rhone by Leman's waters wash'd,\nWhere mingled and yet separate appears\n  The river from the lake, all bluely dash'd\nThrough the serene and placid glassy deep,\nWhich fain would lull its river-child to sleep.\n\nNow when she once had ta'en an interest\n  In any thing, however she might flatter\nHerself that her intentions were the best,\n  Intense intentions are a dangerous matter:\nImpressions were much stronger than she guess'd,\n  And gather'd as they run like growing water\nUpon her mind; the more so, as her breast\nWas not at first too readily impress'd.\n\nBut when it was, she had that lurking demon\n  Of double nature, and thus doubly named—\nFirmness yclept in heroes, kings, and seamen,\n  That is, when they succeed; but greatly blamed\nAs obstinacy, both in men and women,\n  Whene'er their triumph pales, or star is tamed:—\nAnd 't will perplex the casuist in morality\nTo fix the due bounds of this dangerous quality.\n\nHad Buonaparte won at Waterloo,\n  It had been firmness; now 't is pertinacity:\nMust the event decide between the two?\n  I leave it to your people of sagacity\nTo draw the line between the false and true,\n  If such can e'er be drawn by man's capacity:\nMy business is with Lady Adeline,\nWho in her way too was a heroine.\n\nShe knew not her own heart; then how should I?\n  I think not she was then in love with Juan:\nIf so, she would have had the strength to fly\n  The wild sensation, unto her a new one:\nShe merely felt a common sympathy\n  (I will not say it was a false or true one)\nIn him, because she thought he was in danger,—\nHer husband's friend, her own, young, and a stranger,\n\nShe was, or thought she was, his friend—and this\n  Without the farce of friendship, or romance\nOf Platonism, which leads so oft amiss\n  Ladies who have studied friendship but in France,\nOr Germany, where people purely kiss.\n  To thus much Adeline would not advance;\nBut of such friendship as man's may to man be\nShe was as capable as woman can be.\n\nNo doubt the secret influence of the sex\n  Will there, as also in the ties of blood,\nAn innocent predominance annex,\n  And tune the concord to a finer mood.\nIf free from passion, which all friendship checks,\n  And your true feelings fully understood,\nNo friend like to a woman earth discovers,\nSo that you have not been nor will be lovers.\n\nLove bears within its breast the very germ\n  Of change; and how should this be otherwise?\nThat violent things more quickly find a term\n  Is shown through nature's whole analogies;\nAnd how should the most fierce of all be firm?\n  Would you have endless lightning in the skies?\nMethinks Love's very title says enough:\nHow should 'the tender passion' e'er be tough?\n\nAlas! by all experience, seldom yet\n  (I merely quote what I have heard from many)\nHad lovers not some reason to regret\n  The passion which made Solomon a zany.\nI 've also seen some wives (not to forget\n  The marriage state, the best or worst of any)\nWho were the very paragons of wives,\nYet made the misery of at least two lives.\n\nI 've also seen some female friends ( 't is odd,\n  But true—as, if expedient, I could prove)\nThat faithful were through thick and thin, abroad,\n  At home, far more than ever yet was Love—\nWho did not quit me when Oppression trod\n  Upon me; whom no scandal could remove;\nWho fought, and fight, in absence, too, my battles,\nDespite the snake Society's loud rattles.\n\nWhether Don Juan and chaste Adeline\n  Grew friends in this or any other sense,\nWill be discuss'd hereafter, I opine:\n  At present I am glad of a pretence\nTo leave them hovering, as the effect is fine,\n  And keeps the atrocious reader in suspense;\nThe surest way for ladies and for books\nTo bait their tender, or their tenter, hooks.\n\nWhether they rode, or walk'd, or studied Spanish\n  To read Don Quixote in the original,\nA pleasure before which all others vanish;\n  Whether their talk was of the kind call'd 'small,'\nOr serious, are the topics I must banish\n  To the next Canto; where perhaps I shall\nSay something to the purpose, and display\nConsiderable talent in my way.\n\nAbove all, I beg all men to forbear\n  Anticipating aught about the matter:\nThey 'll only make mistakes about the fair,\n  And Juan too, especially the latter.\nAnd I shall take a much more serious air\n  Than I have yet done, in this epic satire.\nIt is not clear that Adeline and Juan\nWill fall; but if they do, 't will be their ruin.\n\nBut great things spring from little:—Would you think,\n  That in our youth, as dangerous a passion\nAs e'er brought man and woman to the brink\n  Of ruin, rose from such a slight occasion,\nAs few would ever dream could form the link\n  Of such a sentimental situation?\nYou 'll never guess, I 'll bet you millions, milliards—\nIt all sprung from a harmless game at billiards.\n\n'T is strange,—but true; for truth is always strange;\n  Stranger than fiction; if it could be told,\nHow much would novels gain by the exchange!\n  How differently the world would men behold!\nHow oft would vice and virtue places change!\n  The new world would be nothing to the old,\nIf some Columbus of the moral seas\nWould show mankind their souls' antipodes.\n\nWhat 'antres vast and deserts idle' then\n  Would be discover'd in the human soul!\nWhat icebergs in the hearts of mighty men,\n  With self-love in the centre as their pole!\nWhat Anthropophagi are nine of ten\n  Of those who hold the kingdoms in control\nWere things but only call'd by their right name,\nCaesar himself would be ashamed of fame.</code>"

that I should say so!\nThey differ as wine differs from its label,\n  When once decanted;—I presume to guess so,\nBut will not swear: yet both upon occasion,\nTill old, may undergo adulteration.\n\nBut Adeline was of the purest vintage,\n  The unmingled essence of the grape; and yet\nBright as a new Napoleon from its mintage,\n  Or glorious as a diamond richly set;\nA page where Time should hesitate to print age,\n  And for which Nature might forego her debt—\nSole creditor whose process doth involve in 't\nThe luck of finding every body solvent.\n\nO Death!

We might fill\nVolumes with similar sad illustrations,\nBut leave them to the conscience of the nations.\n\nI perch upon an humbler promontory,\n  Amidst life's infinite variety:\nWith no great care for what is nicknamed glory,\n  But speculating as I cast mine eye\nOn what may suit or may not suit my story,\n  And never straining hard to versify,\nI rattle on exactly as I 'd talk\nWith any body in a ride or walk.\n\nI don't know that there may be much ability\n  Shown in this sort of desultory rhyme;\nBut there 's a conversational facility,\n  Which may round off an hour upon a time.\nOf this I 'm sure at least, there 's no servility\n  In mine irregularity of chime,\nWhich rings what 's uppermost of new or hoary,\nJust as I feel the 'Improvvisatore.'\n\n'Omnia vult belle Matho dicere—dic aliquando\n  Et bene, dic neutrum, dic aliquando male.'\nThe first is rather more than mortal can do;\n  The second may be sadly done or gaily;\nThe third is still more difficult to stand to;\n  The fourth we hear, and see, and say too, daily.\nThe whole together is what I could wish\nTo serve in this conundrum of a dish.\n\nA modest hope—but modesty 's my forte,\n  And pride my feeble:—let us ramble on.\nI meant to make this poem very short,\n  But now I can't tell where it may not run.\nNo doubt, if I had wish' to pay my court\n  To critics, or to hail the setting sun\nOf tyranny of all kinds, my concision\nWere more;—but I was born for opposition.\n\nBut then 't is mostly on the weaker side;\n  So that I verily believe if they\nWho now are basking in their full-blown pride\n  Were shaken down, and 'dogs had had their day,'\nThough at the first I might perchance deride\n  Their tumble, I should turn the other way,\nAnd wax an ultra-royalist in loyalty,\nBecause I hate even democratic royalty.\n\nI think I should have made a decent spouse,\n  If I had never proved the soft condition;\nI think I should have made monastic vows,\n  But for my own peculiar superstition:\n'Gainst rhyme I never should have knock'd my brows,\n  Nor broken my own head, nor that of Priscian,\nNor worn the motley mantle of a poet,\nIf some one had not told me to forego it.\n\nBut 'laissez aller'—knights and dames I sing,\n  Such as the times may furnish.

I can't tell;\n  I wish she had: his book 's the eleventh commandment,\nWhich says, 'Thou shalt not marry,' unless well:\n  This he (as far as I can understand) meant.\n'T is not my purpose on his views to dwell\n  Nor canvass what so 'eminent a hand' meant;\nBut certes it conducts to lives ascetic,\nOr turning marriage into arithmetic.\n\nBut Adeline, who probably presumed\n  That Juan had enough of maintenance,\nOr separate maintenance, in case 't was doom'd—\n  As on the whole it is an even chance\nThat bridegrooms, after they are fairly groom'd,\n  May retrograde a little in the dance\nOf marriage (which might form a painter's fame,\nLike Holbein's 'Dance of Death'—but 't is the same);—\n\nBut Adeline determined Juan's wedding\n  In her own mind, and that 's enough for woman:\nBut then, with whom? There was the sage Miss Reading,\n  Miss Raw, Miss Flaw, Miss Showman, and Miss Knowman.\nAnd the two fair co-heiresses Giltbedding.\n  She deem'd his merits something more than common:\nAll these were unobjectionable matches,\nAnd might go on, if well wound up, like watches.\n\nThere was Miss Millpond, smooth as summer's sea,\n  That usual paragon, an only daughter,\nWho seem'd the cream of equanimity\n  Till skimm'd—and then there was some milk and water,\nWith a slight shade of blue too, it might be,\n  Beneath the surface; but what did it matter?\nLove 's riotous, but marriage should have quiet,\nAnd being consumptive, live on a milk diet.\n\nAnd then there was the Miss Audacia Shoestring,\n  A dashing demoiselle of good estate,\nWhose heart was fix'd upon a star or blue string;\n  But whether English dukes grew rare of late,\nOr that she had not harp'd upon the true string,\n  By which such sirens can attract our great,\nShe took up with some foreign younger brother,\nA Russ or Turk—the one 's as good as t' other.\n\nAnd then there was—but why should I go on,\n  Unless the ladies should go off?—there was\nIndeed a certain fair and fairy one,\n  Of the best class, and better than her class,—\nAurora Raby, a young star who shone\n  O'er life, too sweet an image for such glass,\nA lovely being, scarcely form'd or moulded,\nA rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;\n\nRich, noble, but an orphan; left an only\n  Child to the care of guardians good and kind;\nBut still her aspect had an air so lonely!\n  Blood is not water; and where shall we find\nFeelings of youth like those which overthrown lie\n  By death, when we are left, alas! behind,\nTo feel, in friendless palaces, a home\nIs wanting, and our best ties in the tomb?\n\nEarly in years, and yet more infantine\n  In figure, she had something of sublime\nIn eyes which sadly shone, as seraphs' shine.\n  All youth—but with an aspect beyond time;\nRadiant and grave—as pitying man's decline;\n  Mournful—but mournful of another's crime,\nShe look'd as if she sat by Eden's door.\nAnd grieved for those who could return no more.\n\nShe was a Catholic, too, sincere, austere,\n  As far as her own gentle heart allow'd,\nAnd deem'd that fallen worship far more dear\n  Perhaps because 't was fallen: her sires were proud\nOf deeds and days when they had fill'd the ear\n  Of nations, and had never bent or bow'd\nTo novel power; and as she was the last,\nShe held their old faith and old feelings fast.\n\nShe gazed upon a world she scarcely knew,\n  As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,\nAs grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,\n  And kept her heart serene within its zone.\nThere was awe in the homage which she drew;\n  Her spirit seem'd as seated on a throne\nApart from the surrounding world, and strong\nIn its own strength—most strange in one so young!\n\nNow it so happen'd, in the catalogue\n  Of Adeline, Aurora was omitted,\nAlthough her birth and wealth had given her vogue\n  Beyond the charmers we have already cited;\nHer beauty also seem'd to form no clog\n  Against her being mention'd as well fitted,\nBy many virtues, to be worth the trouble\nOf single gentlemen who would be double.\n\nAnd this omission, like that of the bust\n  Of Brutus at the pageant of Tiberius,\nMade Juan wonder, as no doubt he must.\n  This he express'd half smiling and half serious;\nWhen Adeline replied with some disgust,\n  And with an air, to say the least, imperious,\nShe marvell'd 'what he saw in such a baby\nAs that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?'\n\nJuan rejoin'd—'She was a Catholic,\n  And therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;\nSince he was sure his mother would fall sick,\n  And the Pope thunder excommunication,\nIf-' But here Adeline, who seem'd to pique\n  Herself extremely on the inoculation\nOf others with her own opinions, stated—\nAs usual—the same reason which she late did.\n\nAnd wherefore not? A reasonable reason,\n  If good, is none the worse for repetition;\nIf bad, the best way 's certainly to tease on,\n  And amplify: you lose much by concision,\nWhereas insisting in or out of season\n  Convinces all men, even a politician;\nOr—what is just the same—it wearies out.\nSo the end 's gain'd, what signifies the route?\n\nWhy Adeline had this slight prejudice—\n  For prejudice it was—against a creature\nAs pure as sanctity itself from vice,\n  With all the added charm of form and feature,\nFor me appears a question far too nice,\n  Since Adeline was liberal by nature;\nBut nature 's nature, and has more caprices\nThan I have time, or will, to take to pieces.\n\nPerhaps she did not like the quiet way\n  With which Aurora on those baubles look'd,\nWhich charm most people in their earlier day:\n  For there are few things by mankind less brook'd,\nAnd womankind too, if we so may say,\n  Than finding thus their genius stand rebuked,\nLike 'Anthony's by Caesar,' by the few\nWho look upon them as they ought to do.\n\nIt was not envy—Adeline had none;\n  Her place was far beyond it, and her mind.\nIt was not scorn—which could not light on one\n  Whose greatest fault was leaving few to find.\nIt was not jealousy, I think: but shun\n  Following the 'ignes fatui' of mankind.\nIt was not—but 't is easier far, alas!\nTo say what it was not than what it was.\n\nLittle Aurora deem'd she was the theme\n  Of such discussion. She was there a guest;\nA beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream\n  Of rank and youth, though purer than the rest,\nWhich flow'd on for a moment in the beam\n  Time sheds a moment o'er each sparkling crest.\nHad she known this, she would have calmly smiled—\nShe had so much, or little, of the child.\n\nThe dashing and proud air of Adeline\n  Imposed not upon her: she saw her blaze\nMuch as she would have seen a glow-worm shine,\n  Then turn'd unto the stars for loftier rays.\nJuan was something she could not divine,\n  Being no sibyl in the new world's ways;\nYet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor,\nBecause she did not pin her faith on feature.\n\nHis fame too,—for he had that kind of fame\n  Which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind,\nA heterogeneous mass of glorious blame,\n  Half virtues and whole vices being combined;\nFaults which attract because they are not tame;\n  Follies trick'd out so brightly that they blind:—\nThese seals upon her wax made no impression,\nSuch was her coldness or her self-possession.\n\nJuan knew nought of such a character—\n  High, yet resembling not his lost Haidee;\nYet each was radiant in her proper sphere:\n  The island girl, bred up by the lone sea,\nMore warm, as lovely, and not less sincere,\n  Was Nature's all: Aurora could not be,\nNor would be thus:—the difference in them\nWas such as lies between a flower and gem.\n\nHaving wound up with this sublime comparison,\n  Methinks we may proceed upon our narrative,\nAnd, as my friend Scott says, 'I sound my warison;'\n  Scott, the superlative of my comparative—\nScott, who can paint your Christian knight or Saracen,\n  Serf, lord, man, with such skill as none would share it, if\nThere had not been one Shakspeare and Voltaire,\nOf one or both of whom he seems the heir.\n\nI say, in my slight way I may proceed\n  To play upon the surface of humanity.\nI write the world, nor care if the world read,\n  At least for this I cannot spare its vanity.\nMy Muse hath bred, and still perhaps may breed\n  More foes by this same scroll: when I began it, I\nThought that it might turn out so—now I know it,\nBut still I am, or was, a pretty poet.\n\nThe conference or congress (for it ended\n  As congresses of late do) of the Lady\nAdeline and Don Juan rather blended\n  Some acids with the sweets—for she was heady;\nBut, ere the matter could be marr'd or mended,\n  The silvery bell rang, not for 'dinner ready,\nBut for that hour, call'd half-hour, given to dress,\nThough ladies' robes seem scant enough for less.\n\nGreat things were now to be achieved at table,\n  With massy plate for armour, knives and forks\nFor weapons; but what Muse since Homer 's able\n  (His feasts are not the worst part of his works)\nTo draw up in array a single day-bill\n  Of modern dinners? where more mystery lurks,\nIn soups or sauces, or a sole ragout,\n  Than witches, b�ches, or physicians, brew.\n\nThere was a goodly 'soupe a la bonne femme,'\n  Though God knows whence it came from; there was, too,\nA turbot for relief of those who cram,\n  Relieved with 'dindon a la Parigeux;'\nThere also was��the sinner that I am!\n  How shall I get this gourmand stanza through?-\n'Soupe a la Beauveau,' whose relief was dory,\nRelieved itself by pork, for greater glory.\n\nBut I must crowd all into one grand mess\n  Or mass; for should I stretch into detail,\nMy Muse would run much more into excess,\n  Than when some squeamish people deem her frail.\nBut though a 'bonne vivante,' I must confess\n  Her stomach 's not her peccant part; this tale\nHowever doth require some slight refection,\nJust to relieve her spirits from dejection.\n\nFowls 'a la Conde,' slices eke of salmon,\n  With 'sauces Genevoises,' and haunch of venison;\nWines too, which might again have slain young Ammon—\n  A man like whom I hope we shan't see many soon;\nThey also set a glazed Westphalian ham on,\n  Whereon Apicius would bestow his benison;\nAnd then there was champagne with foaming whirls,\nAs white as Cleopatra's melted pearls.\n\nThen there was God knows what 'a l'Allemande,'\n  'A l'Espagnole,' 'timballe,' and 'salpicon'-\nWith things I can't withstand or understand,\n  Though swallow'd with much zest upon the whole;\nAnd 'entremets' to piddle with at hand,\n  Gently to lull down the subsiding soul;\nWhile great Lucullus' Robe triumphal muffles\n(There 's fame) young partridge fillets, deck'd with truffles.\n\nWhat are the fillets on the victor's brow\n  To these? They are rags or dust. Where is the arch\nWhich nodded to the nation's spoils below?\n  Where the triumphal chariots' haughty march?\nGone to where victories must like dinners go.\n  Farther I shall not follow the research:\nBut oh! ye modern heroes with your cartridges,\nWhen will your names lend lustre e'en to partridges?\n\nThose truffles too are no bad accessaries,\n  Follow'd by 'petits puits d'amour'—a dish\nOf which perhaps the cookery rather varies,\n  So every one may dress it to his wish,\nAccording to the best of dictionaries,\n  Which encyclopedize both flesh and fish;\nBut even sans 'confitures,' it no less true is,\nThere 's pretty picking in those 'petits puits.'\n\nThe mind is lost in mighty contemplation\n  Of intellect expanded on two courses;\nAnd indigestion's grand multiplication\n  Requires arithmetic beyond my forces.\nWho would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,\n  That cookery could have call'd forth such resources,\nAs form a science and a nomenclature\nFrom out the commonest demands of nature?\n\nThe glasses jingled, and the palates tingled;\n  The diners of celebrity dined well;\nThe ladies with more moderation mingled\n  In the feast, pecking less than I can tell;\nAlso the younger men too: for a springald\n  Can't, like ripe age, in gormandize excel,\nBut thinks less of good eating than the whisper\n(When seated next him) of some pretty lisper.\n\nAlas! I must leave undescribed the gibier,\n  The salmi, the consomme, the puree,\nAll which I use to make my rhymes run glibber\n  Than could roast beef in our rough John Bull way:\nI must not introduce even a spare rib here,\n  'Bubble and squeak' would spoil my liquid lay:\nBut I have dined, and must forego, Alas!\nThe chaste description even of a 'becasse;'\n\nAnd fruits, and ice, and all that art refines\n  From nature for the service of the gout—\nTaste or the gout,—pronounce it as inclines\n  Your stomach! Ere you dine, the French will do;\nBut after, there are sometimes certain signs\n  Which prove plain English truer of the two.\nHast ever had the gout? I have not had it—\nBut I may have, and you too, reader, dread it.\n\nThe simple olives, best allies of wine,\n  Must I pass over in my bill of fare?\nI must, although a favourite 'plat' of mine\n  In Spain, and Lucca, Athens, every where:\nOn them and bread 't was oft my luck to dine,\n  The grass my table-cloth, in open-air,\nOn Sunium or Hymettus, like Diogenes,\nOf whom half my philosophy the progeny is.\n\nAmidst this tumult of fish, flesh, and 'fowl,\n  And vegetables, all in masquerade,\nThe guests were placed according to their roll,\n  But various as the various meats display'd:\nDon Juan sat next 'an l'Espagnole'-\n  No damsel, but a dish, as hath been said;\nBut so far like a lady, that 't was drest\nSuperbly, and contain'd a world of zest.\n\nBy some odd chance too, he was placed between\n  Aurora and the Lady Adeline—\nA situation difficult, I ween,\n  For man therein, with eyes and heart, to dine.\nAlso the conference which we have seen\n  Was not such as to encourage him to shine;\nFor Adeline, addressing few words to him,\nWith two transcendent eyes seem'd to look through him.\n\nI sometimes almost think that eyes have ears:\n  This much is sure, that, out of earshot, things\nAre somehow echoed to the pretty dears,\n  Of which I can't tell whence their knowledge springs.\nLike that same mystic music of the spheres,\n  Which no one bears, so loudly though it rings,\n'T is wonderful how oft the sex have heard\nLong dialogues—which pass'd without a word!\n\nAurora sat with that indifference\n  Which piques a preux chevalier—as it ought:\nOf all offences that 's the worst offence,\n  Which seems to hint you are not worth a thought.\nNow Juan, though no coxcomb in pretence,\n  Was not exactly pleased to be so caught;\nLike a good ship entangled among ice,\nAnd after so much excellent advice.\n\nTo his gay nothings, nothing was replied,\n  Or something which was nothing, as urbanity\nRequired. Aurora scarcely look'd aside,\n  Nor even smiled enough for any vanity.\nThe devil was in the girl! Could it be pride?\n  Or modesty, or absence, or inanity?\nHeaven knows? But Adeline's malicious eyes\nSparkled with her successful prophecies,\n\nAnd look'd as much as if to say, 'I said it;'\n  A kind of triumph I 'll not recommend,\nBecause it sometimes, as I have seen or read it,\n  Both in the case of lover and of friend,\nWill pique a gentleman, for his own credit,\n  To bring what was a jest to a serious end:\nFor all men prophesy what is or was,\nAnd hate those who won't let them come to pass.\n\nJuan was drawn thus into some attentions,\n  Slight but select, and just enough to express,\nTo females of perspicuous comprehensions,\n  That he would rather make them more than less.\nAurora at the last (so history mentions,\n  Though probably much less a fact than guess)\nSo far relax'd her thoughts from their sweet prison,\nAs once or twice to smile, if not to listen.\n\nFrom answering she began to question; this\n  With her was rare: and Adeline, who as yet\nThought her predictions went not much amiss,\n  Began to dread she'd thaw to a coquette—\nSo very difficult, they say, it is\n  To keep extremes from meeting, when once set\nIn motion; but she here too much refined—\nAurora's spirit was not of that kind.\n\nBut Juan had a sort of winning way,\n  A proud humility, if such there be,\nWhich show'd such deference to what females say,\n  As if each charming word were a decree.\nHis tact, too, temper'd him from grave to gay,\n  And taught him when to be reserved or free:\nHe had the art of drawing people out,\nWithout their seeing what he was about.\n\nAurora, who in her indifference\n  Confounded him in common with the crowd\nOf flatterers, though she deem'd he had more sense\n  Than whispering foplings, or than witlings loud—\nCommenced (from such slight things will great commence)\n  To feel that flattery which attracts the proud\nRather by deference than compliment,\nAnd wins even by a delicate dissent.\n\nAnd then he had good looks;—that point was carried\n  Nem. con. amongst the women, which I grieve\nTo say leads oft to crim. con. with the married—\n  A case which to the juries we may leave,\nSince with digressions we too long have tarried.\n  Now though we know of old that looks deceive,\nAnd always have done, somehow these good looks\nMake more impression than the best of books.\n\nAurora, who look'd more on books than faces,\n  Was very young, although so very sage,\nAdmiring more Minerva than the Graces,\n  Especially upon a printed page.\nBut Virtue's self, with all her tightest laces,\n  Has not the natural stays of strict old age;\nAnd Socrates, that model of all duty,\nOwn'd to a penchant, though discreet, for beauty.\n\nAnd girls of sixteen are thus far Socratic,\n  But innocently so, as Socrates;\nAnd really, if the sage sublime and Attic\n  At seventy years had phantasies like these,\nWhich Plato in his dialogues dramatic\n  Has shown, I know not why they should displease\nIn virgins—always in a modest way,\nObserve; for that with me 's a 'sine qua.'\n\nAlso observe, that, like the great Lord Coke\n  (See Littleton), whene'er I have express'd\nOpinions two, which at first sight may look\n  Twin opposites, the second is the best.\nPerhaps I have a third, too, in a nook,\n  Or none at all—which seems a sorry jest:\nBut if a writer should be quite consistent,\nHow could he possibly show things existent?\n\nIf people contradict themselves, can I\n  Help contradicting them, and every body,\nEven my veracious self?—But that 's a lie:\n  I never did so, never will—how should I?\nHe who doubts all things nothing can deny:\n  Truth's fountains may be clear—her streams are muddy,\nAnd cut through such canals of contradiction,\nThat she must often navigate o'er fiction.\n\nApologue, fable, poesy, and parable,\n  Are false, but may he render'd also true,\nBy those who sow them in a land that 's arable.\n  'T is wonderful what fable will not do!\n'T is said it makes reality more bearable:\n  But what 's reality? Who has its clue?\nPhilosophy? No: she too much rejects.\nReligion? Yes; but which of all her sects?\n\nSome millions must be wrong, that 's pretty dear;\n  Perhaps it may turn out that all were right.\nGod help us! Since we have need on our career\n  To keep our holy beacons always bright,\n'T is time that some new prophet should appear,\n  Or old indulge man with a second sight.\nOpinions wear out in some thousand years,\nWithout a small refreshment from the spheres.\n\nBut here again, why will I thus entangle\n  Myself with metaphysics? None can hate\nSo much as I do any kind of wrangle;\n  And yet, such is my folly, or my fate,\nI always knock my head against some angle\n  About the present, past, or future state.\nYet I wish well to Trojan and to Tyrian,\nFor I was bred a moderate Presbyterian.\n\nBut though I am a temperate theologian,\n  And also meek as a metaphysician,\nImpartial between Tyrian and Trojan,\n  As Eldon on a lunatic commission—\nIn politics my duty is to show John\n  Bull something of the lower world's condition.\nIt makes my blood boil like the springs of Hecla,\nTo see men let these scoundrel sovereigns break law.\n\nBut politics, and policy, and piety,\n  Are topics which I sometimes introduce,\nNot only for the sake of their variety,\n  But as subservient to a moral use;\nBecause my business is to dress society,\n  And stuff with sage that very verdant goose.\nAnd now, that we may furnish with some matter all\nTastes, we are going to try the supernatural.\n\nAnd now I will give up all argument;\n  And positively henceforth no temptation\nShall 'fool me to the top up of my bent:'-\n  Yes, I' ll begin a thorough reformation.\nIndeed, I never knew what people meant\n  By deeming that my Muse's conversation\nWas dangerous;—I think she is as harmless\nAs some who labour more and yet may charm less.\n\nGrim reader! did you ever see a ghost?\n  No; but you have heard—I understand—be dumb!\nAnd don't regret the time you may have lost,\n  For you have got that pleasure still to come:\nAnd do not think I mean to sneer at most\n  Of these things, or by ridicule benumb\nThat source of the sublime and the mysterious:—\nFor certain reasons my belief is serious.\n\nSerious? You laugh;—you may: that will I not;\n  My smiles must be sincere or not at all.\nI say I do believe a haunted spot\n  Exists—and where? That shall I not recall,\nBecause I 'd rather it should be forgot,\n  'Shadows the soul of Richard' may appal.\nIn short, upon that subject I 've some qualms very\nLike those of the philosopher of Malmsbury.\n\nThe night (I sing by night—sometimes an owl,\n  And now and then a nightingale) is dim,\nAnd the loud shriek of sage Minerva's fowl\n  Rattles around me her discordant hymn:\nOld portraits from old walls upon me scowl—\n  I wish to heaven they would not look so grim;\nThe dying embers dwindle in the grate—\nI think too that I have sate up too late:\n\nAnd therefore, though 't is by no means my way\n  To rhyme at noon—when I have other things\nTo think of, if I ever think—I say\n  I feel some chilly midnight shudderings,\nAnd prudently postpone, until mid-day,\n  Treating a topic which, alas! but brings\nShadows;—but you must be in my condition\nBefore you learn to call this superstition.</code>"

I only know it so befell.\nHave you explored the limits of the coast,\n  Where all the dwellers of the earth must dwell?\n'T is time to strike such puny doubters dumb as\nThe sceptics who would not believe Columbus.\n\nSome people would impose now with authority,\n  Turpin's or Monmouth Geoffry's Chronicle;\nMen whose historical superiority\n  Is always greatest at a miracle.\nBut Saint Augustine has the great priority,\n  Who bids all men believe the impossible,\nBecause 't is so. Who nibble, scribble, quibble, he\nQuiets at once with 'quia impossibile.'\n\nAnd therefore, mortals, cavil not at all;\n  Believe:—if 't is improbable you must,\nAnd if it is impossible, you shall:\n  'T is always best to take things upon trust.\nI do not speak profanely, to recall\n  Those holier mysteries which the wise and just\nReceive as gospel, and which grow more rooted,\nAs all truths must, the more they are disputed:\n\nI merely mean to say what Johnson said,\n  That in the course of some six thousand years,\nAll nations have believed that from the dead\n  A visitant at intervals appears;\nAnd what is strangest upon this strange head,\n  Is, that whatever bar the reason rears\n'Gainst such belief, there 's something stronger still\nIn its behalf, let those deny who will.\n\nThe dinner and the soiree too were done,\n  The supper too discuss'd, the dames admired,\nThe banqueteers had dropp'd off one by one—\n  The song was silent, and the dance expired:\nThe last thin petticoats were vanish'd, gone\n  Like fleecy Clouds into the sky retired,\nAnd nothing brighter gleam'd through the saloon\nThan dying tapers—and the peeping moon.\n\nThe evaporation of a joyous day\n  Is like the last glass of champagne, without\nThe foam which made its virgin bumper gay;\n  Or like a system coupled with a doubt;\nOr like a soda bottle when its spray\n  Has sparkled and let half its spirit out;\nOr like a billow left by storms behind,\nWithout the animation of the wind;\n\nOr like an opiate, which brings troubled rest,\n  Or none; or like—like nothing that I know\nExcept itself;—such is the human breast;\n  A thing, of which similitudes can show\nNo real likeness,—like the old Tyrian vest\n  Dyed purple, none at present can tell how,\nIf from a shell-fish or from cochineal.\nSo perish every tyrant's robe piece-meal!\n\nBut next to dressing for a rout or ball,\n  Undressing is a woe; our robe de chambre\nMay sit like that of Nessus, and recall\n  Thoughts quite as yellow, but less clear than amber.\nTitus exclaim'd, 'I 've lost a day!' Of all\n  The nights and days most people can remember\n(I have had of both, some not to be disdain'd),\nI wish they 'd state how many they have gain'd.\n\nAnd Juan, on retiring for the night,\n  Felt restless, and perplex'd, and compromised:\nHe thought Aurora Raby's eyes more bright\n  Than Adeline (such is advice) advised;\nIf he had known exactly his own plight,\n  He probably would have philosophised:\nA great resource to all, and ne'er denied\nTill wanted; therefore Juan only sigh'd.\n\nHe sigh'd;—the next resource is the full moon,\n  Where all sighs are deposited; and now\nIt happen'd luckily, the chaste orb shone\n  As clear as such a climate will allow;\nAnd Juan's mind was in the proper tone\n  To hail her with the apostrophe—'O thou!'\nOf amatory egotism the Tuism,\nWhich further to explain would be a truism.\n\nBut lover, poet, or astronomer,\n  Shepherd, or swain, whoever may behold,\nFeel some abstraction when they gaze on her:\n  Great thoughts we catch from thence (besides a cold\nSometimes, unless my feelings rather err);\n  Deep secrets to her rolling light are told;\nThe ocean's tides and mortals' brains she sways,\nAnd also hearts, if there be truth in lays.\n\nJuan felt somewhat pensive, and disposed\n  For contemplation rather than his pillow:\nThe Gothic chamber, where he was enclosed,\n  Let in the rippling sound of the lake's billow,\nWith all the mystery by midnight caused;\n  Below his window waved (of course) a willow;\nAnd he stood gazing out on the cascade\nThat flash'd and after darken'd in the shade.\n\nUpon his table or his toilet,—which\n  Of these is not exactly ascertain'd\n(I state this, for I am cautious to a pitch\n  Of nicety, where a fact is to be gain'd),—\nA lamp burn'd high, while he leant from a niche,\n  Where many a Gothic ornament remain'd,\nIn chisell'd stone and painted glass, and all\nThat time has left our fathers of their hall.\n\nThen, as the night was clear though cold, he threw\n  His chamber door wide open—and went forth\nInto a gallery, of a sombre hue,\n  Long, furnish'd with old pictures of great worth,\nOf knights and dames heroic and chaste too,\n  As doubtless should be people of high birth.\nBut by dim lights the portraits of the dead\nHave something ghastly, desolate, and dread.\n\nThe forms of the grim knight and pictured saint\n  Look living in the moon; and as you turn\nBackward and forward to the echoes faint\n  Of your own footsteps—voices from the urn\nAppear to wake, and shadows wild and quaint\n  Start from the frames which fence their aspects stern,\nAs if to ask how you can dare to keep\nA vigil there, where all but death should sleep.\n\nAnd the pale smile of beauties in the grave,\n  The charms of other days, in starlight gleams,\nGlimmer on high; their buried locks still wave\n  Along the canvas; their eyes glance like dreams\nOn ours, or spars within some dusky cave,\n  But death is imaged in their shadowy beams.\nA picture is the past; even ere its frame\nBe gilt, who sate hath ceased to be the same.\n\nAs Juan mused on mutability,\n  Or on his mistress—terms synonymous—\nNo sound except the echo of his sigh\n  Or step ran sadly through that antique house;\nWhen suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,\n  A supernatural agent—or a mouse,\nWhose little nibbling rustle will embarrass\nMost people as it plays along the arras.\n\nIt was no mouse, but lo! a monk, array'd\n  In cowl and beads and dusky garb, appear'd,\nNow in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,\n  With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;\nHis garments only a slight murmur made;\n  He moved as shadowy as the sisters weird,\nBut slowly; and as he pass'd Juan by,\nGlanced, without pausing, on him a bright eye.\n\nJuan was petrified; he had heard a hint\n  Of such a spirit in these halls of old,\nBut thought, like most men, there was nothing in 't\n  Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,\nCoin'd from surviving superstition's mint,\n  Which passes ghosts in currency like gold,\nBut rarely seen, like gold compared with paper.\nAnd did he see this? or was it a vapour?\n\nOnce, twice, thrice pass'd, repass'd—the thing of air,\n  Or earth beneath, or heaven, or t' other place;\nAnd Juan gazed upon it with a stare,\n  Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base\nAs stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair\n  Twine like a knot of snakes around his face;\nHe tax'd his tongue for words, which were not granted,\nTo ask the reverend person what he wanted.\n\nThe third time, after a still longer pause,\n  The shadow pass'd away—but where? the hall\nWas long, and thus far there was no great cause\n  To think his vanishing unnatural:\nDoors there were many, through which, by the laws\n  Of physics, bodies whether short or tall\nMight come or go; but Juan could not state\nThrough which the spectre seem'd to evaporate.\n\nHe stood—how long he knew not, but it seem'd\n  An age—expectant, powerless, with his eyes\nStrain'd on the spot where first the figure gleam'd;\n  Then by degrees recall'd his energies,\nAnd would have pass'd the whole off as a dream,\n  But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,\nWaking already, and return'd at length\nBack to his chamber, shorn of half his strength.\n\nAll there was as he left it: still his taper\n  Burnt, and not blue, as modest tapers use,\nReceiving sprites with sympathetic vapour;\n  He rubb'd his eyes, and they did not refuse\nTheir office; he took up an old newspaper;\n  The paper was right easy to peruse;\nHe read an article the king attacking,\nAnd a long eulogy of 'patent blacking.'\n\nThis savour'd of this world; but his hand shook—\n  He shut his door, and after having read\nA paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,\n  Undrest, and rather slowly went to bed.\nThere, couch'd all snugly on his pillow's nook,\n  With what he had seen his phantasy he fed;\nAnd though it was no opiate, slumber crept\nUpon him by degrees, and so he slept.\n\nHe woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,\n  Ponder'd upon his visitant or vision,\nAnd whether it ought not to be disclosed,\n  At risk of being quizz'd for superstition.\nThe more he thought, the more his mind was posed:\n  In the mean time, his valet, whose precision\nWas great, because his master brook'd no less,\nKnock'd to inform him it was time to dress.\n\nHe dress'd; and like young people he was wont\n  To take some trouble with his toilet, but\nThis morning rather spent less time upon 't;\n  Aside his very mirror soon was put;\nHis curls fell negligently o'er his front,\n  His clothes were not curb'd to their usual cut,\nHis very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied\nAlmost an hair's breadth too much on one side.\n\nAnd when he walk'd down into the saloon,\n  He sate him pensive o'er a dish of tea,\nWhich he perhaps had not discover'd soon,\n  Had it not happen'd scalding hot to be,\nWhich made him have recourse unto his spoon;\n  So much distrait he was, that all could see\nThat something was the matter—Adeline\nThe first—but what she could not well divine.\n\nShe look'd, and saw him pale, and turn'd as pale\n  Herself; then hastily look'd down, and mutter'd\nSomething, but what 's not stated in my tale.\n  Lord Henry said his muffin was ill butter'd;\nThe Duchess of Fitz-Fulke play'd with her veil,\n  And look'd at Juan hard, but nothing utter'd.\nAurora Raby with her large dark eyes\nSurvey'd him with a kind of calm surprise.\n\nBut seeing him all cold and silent still,\n  And everybody wondering more or less,\nFair Adeline enquired, 'If he were ill?'\n  He started, and said, 'Yes—no—rather—yes.'\nThe family physician had great skill,\n  And being present, now began to express\nHis readiness to feel his pulse and tell\nThe cause, but Juan said, 'He was quite well.'\n\n'Quite well; yes,—no.'—These answers were mysterious,\n  And yet his looks appear'd to sanction both,\nHowever they might savour of delirious;\n  Something like illness of a sudden growth\nWeigh'd on his spirit, though by no means serious:\n  But for the rest, as he himself seem'd loth\nTo state the case, it might be ta'en for granted\nIt was not the physician that he wanted.\n\nLord Henry, who had now discuss'd his chocolate,\n  Also the muffin whereof he complain'd,\nSaid, Juan had not got his usual look elate,\n  At which he marvell'd, since it had not rain'd;\nThen ask'd her Grace what news were of the duke of late?\n  Her Grace replied, his Grace was rather pain'd\nWith some slight, light, hereditary twinges\nOf gout, which rusts aristocratic hinges.\n\nThen Henry turn'd to Juan, and address'd\n  A few words of condolence on his state:\n'You look,' quoth he, 'as if you had had your rest\n  Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late.'\n'What friar?' said Juan; and he did his best\n  To put the question with an air sedate,\nOr careless; but the effort was not valid\nTo hinder him from growing still more pallid.\n\n'Oh! have you never heard of the Black Friar?\n  The spirit of these walls?'—'In truth not I.'\n'Why Fame—but Fame you know 's sometimes a liar—\n  Tells an odd story, of which by and by:\nWhether with time the spectre has grown shyer,\n  Or that our sires had a more gifted eye\nFor such sights, though the tale is half believed,\nThe friar of late has not been oft perceived.\n\"The last time was��\"�\"I pray,\" said Adeline�\n  (Who watch'd the changes of Don Juan's brow,\nAnd from its context thought she could divine\n  Connexions stronger then he chose to avow\nWith this same legend)—'if you but design\n  To jest, you 'll choose some other theme just now,\nBecause the present tale has oft been told,\nAnd is not much improved by growing old.'\n\n'Jest!' quoth Milor; 'why, Adeline, you know\n  That we ourselves—'t was in the honey-moon—\nSaw��\"�\"Well, no matter, 'twas so long ago;\n  But, come, I 'll set your story to a tune.'\nGraceful as Dian, when she draws her bow,\n  She seized her harp, whose strings were kindled soon\nAs touch'd, and plaintively began to play\nThe air of ''T was a Friar of Orders Gray.'\n\n'But add the words,' cried Henry, 'which you made;\n  For Adeline is half a poetess,'\nTurning round to the rest, he smiling said.\n  Of course the others could not but express\nIn courtesy their wish to see display'd\n  By one three talents, for there were no less—\nThe voice, the words, the harper's skill, at once\nCould hardly be united by a dunce.\n\nAfter some fascinating hesitation,—\n  The charming of these charmers, who seem bound,\nI can't tell why, to this dissimulation,—\n  Fair Adeline, with eyes fix'd on the ground\nAt first, then kindling into animation,\n  Added her sweet voice to the lyric sound,\nAnd sang with much simplicity,—a merit\nNot the less precious, that we seldom hear it.\n\n     Beware! beware! of the Black Friar,\n       Who sitteth by Norman stone,\n     For he mutters his prayer in the midnight air,\n       And his mass of the days that are gone.\n     When the Lord of the Hill, Amundeville,\n       Made Norman Church his prey,\n     And expell'd the friars, one friar still\n       Would not be driven away.\n\n     Though he came in his might, with King Henry's right,\n       To turn church lands to lay,\n     With sword in hand, and torch to light\n       Their walls, if they said nay;\n     A monk remain'd, unchased, unchain'd,\n       And he did not seem form'd of clay,\n     For he 's seen in the porch, and he 's seen in the church,\n       Though he is not seen by day.\n\n     And whether for good, or whether for ill,\n       It is not mine to say;\n     But still with the house of Amundeville\n       He abideth night and day.\n     By the marriage-bed of their lords, 't is said,\n       He flits on the bridal eve;\n     And 't is held as faith, to their bed of death\n       He comes—but not to grieve.\n\n     When an heir is born, he 's heard to mourn,\n       And when aught is to befall\n     That ancient line, in the \"we moonshine\n       He walks from hall to hall.\n     His form you may trace, but not his face,\n       'T is shadow'd by his cowl;\n     But his eyes may be seen from the folds between,\n       And they seem of a parted soul.\n\n     But beware! beware! of the Black Friar,\n       He still retains his sway,\n     For he is yet the church's heir\n       Whoever may be the lay.\n     Amundeville is lord by day,\n       But the monk is lord by night;\n     Nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal\n       To question that friar's right.\n\n     Say nought to him as he walks the hall,\n       And he 'll say nought to you;\n     He sweeps along in his dusky pall,\n       As o'er the grass the dew.\n     Then grammercy! for the Black Friar;\n       Heaven sain him, fair or foul!\n     And whatsoe'er may be his prayer,\n       Let ours be for his soul.\n\nThe lady's voice ceased, and the thrilling wires\n  Died from the touch that kindled them to sound;\nAnd the pause follow'd, which when song expires\n  Pervades a moment those who listen round;\nAnd then of course the circle much admires,\n  Nor less applauds, as in politeness bound,\nThe tones, the feeling, and the execution,\nTo the performer's diffident confusion.\n\nFair Adeline, though in a careless way,\n  As if she rated such accomplishment\nAs the mere pastime of an idle day,\n  Pursued an instant for her own content,\nWould now and then as 't were without display,\n  Yet with display in fact, at times relent\nTo such performances with haughty smile,\nTo show she could, if it were worth her while.\n\nNow this (but we will whisper it aside)\n  Was—pardon the pedantic illustration—\nTrampling on Plato's pride with greater pride,\n  As did the Cynic on some like occasion;\nDeeming the sage would be much mortified,\n  Or thrown into a philosophic passion,\nFor a spoil'd carpet—but the 'Attic Bee'\nWas much consoled by his own repartee.\n\nThus Adeline would throw into the shade\n  (By doing easily, whene'er she chose,\nWhat dilettanti do with vast parade)\n  Their sort of half profession; for it grows\nTo something like this when too oft display'd;\n  And that it is so everybody knows\nWho have heard Miss That or This, or Lady T'other,\nShow off—to please their company or mother.\n\nO! the long evenings of duets and trios!\n  The admirations and the speculations;\nThe 'Mamma Mia's!' and the 'Amor Mio's!'\n  The 'Tanti palpiti's' on such occasions:\nThe 'Lasciami's,' and quavering 'Addio's!'\n  Amongst our own most musical of nations;\nWith 'Tu mi chamas's' from Portingale,\nTo soothe our ears, lest Italy should fail.\n\nIn Babylon's bravuras—as the home\n  Heart-ballads of Green Erin or Gray Highlands,\nThat bring Lochaber back to eyes that roam\n  O'er far Atlantic continents or islands,\nThe calentures of music which o'ercome\n  All mountaineers with dreams that they are nigh lands,\nNo more to be beheld but in such visions—\nWas Adeline well versed, as compositions.\n\nShe also had a twilight tinge of 'Blue,'\n  Could write rhymes, and compose more than she wrote,\nMade epigrams occasionally too\n  Upon her friends, as everybody ought.\nBut still from that sublimer azure hue,\n  So much the present dye, she was remote;\nWas weak enough to deem Pope a great poet,\nAnd what was worse, was not ashamed to show it.\n\nAurora—since we are touching upon taste,\n  Which now-a-days is the thermometer\nBy whose degrees all characters are class'd—\n  Was more Shakspearian, if I do not err.\nThe worlds beyond this world's perplexing waste\n  Had more of her existence, for in her\nThere was a depth of feeling to embrace\nThoughts, boundless, deep, but silent too as Space.\n\nNot so her gracious, graceful, graceless Grace,\n  The full-grown Hebe of Fitz-Fulke, whose mind,\nIf she had any, was upon her face,\n  And that was of a fascinating kind.\nA little turn for mischief you might trace\n  Also thereon,—but that 's not much; we find\nFew females without some such gentle leaven,\nFor fear we should suppose us quite in heaven.\n\nI have not heard she was at all poetic,\n  Though once she was seen reading the 'Bath Guide,'\nAnd 'Hayley's Triumphs,' which she deem'd pathetic,\n  Because she said her temper had been tried\nSo much, the bard had really been prophetic\n  Of what she had gone through with—since a bride.\nBut of all verse, what most ensured her praise\nWere sonnets to herself, or 'bouts rimes.'\n\n'T were difficult to say what was the object\n  Of Adeline, in bringing this same lay\nTo bear on what appear'd to her the subject\n  Of Juan's nervous feelings on that day.\nPerhaps she merely had the simple project\n  To laugh him out of his supposed dismay;\nPerhaps she might wish to confirm him in it,\nThough why I cannot say—at least this minute.\n\nBut so far the immediate effect\n  Was to restore him to his self-propriety,\nA thing quite necessary to the elect,\n  Who wish to take the tone of their society:\nIn which you cannot be too circumspect,\n  Whether the mode be persiflage or piety,\nBut wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,\nOn pain of much displeasing the gynocracy.\n\nAnd therefore Juan now began to rally\n  His spirits, and without more explanation\nTo jest upon such themes in many a sally.\n  Her Grace, too, also seized the same occasion,\nWith various similar remarks to tally,\n  But wish'd for a still more detail'd narration\nOf this same mystic friar's curious doings,\nAbout the present family's deaths and wooings.\n\nOf these few could say more than has been said;\n  They pass'd as such things do, for superstition\nWith some, while others, who had more in dread\n  The theme, half credited the strange tradition;\nAnd much was talk'd on all sides on that head:\n  But Juan, when cross-question'd on the vision,\nWhich some supposed (though he had not avow'd it)\nHad stirr'd him, answer'd in a way to cloud it.\n\nAnd then, the mid-day having worn to one,\n  The company prepared to separate;\nSome to their several pastimes, or to none,\n  Some wondering 't was so early, some so late.\nThere was a goodly match too, to be run\n  Between some greyhounds on my lord's estate,\nAnd a young race-horse of old pedigree\nMatch'd for the spring, whom several went to see.\n\nThere was a picture-dealer who had brought\n  A special Titian, warranted original,\nSo precious that it was not to be bought,\n  Though princes the possessor were besieging all.\nThe king himself had cheapen'd it, but thought\n  The civil list he deigns to accept (obliging all\nHis subjects by his gracious acceptation)\nToo scanty, in these times of low taxation.\n\nBut as Lord Henry was a connoisseur,—\n  The friend of artists, if not arts,—the owner,\nWith motives the most classical and pure,\n  So that he would have been the very donor,\nRather than seller, had his wants been fewer,\n  So much he deem'd his patronage an honour,\nHad brought the capo d'opera, not for sale,\nBut for his judgment—never known to fail.\n\nThere was a modern Goth, I mean a Gothic\n  Bricklayer of Babel, call'd an architect,\nBrought to survey these grey walls, which though so thick,\n  Might have from time acquired some slight defect;\nWho after rummaging the Abbey through thick\n  And thin, produced a plan whereby to erect\nNew buildings of correctest conformation,\nAnd throw down old—which he call'd restoration.\n\nThe cost would be a trifle—an 'old song,'\n  Set to some thousands ('t is the usual burden\nOf that same tune, when people hum it long)—\n  The price would speedily repay its worth in\nAn edifice no less sublime than strong,\n  By which Lord Henry's good taste would go forth in\nIts glory, through all ages shining sunny,\nFor Gothic daring shown in English money.\n\nThere were two lawyers busy on a mortgage\n  Lord Henry wish'd to raise for a new purchase;\nAlso a lawsuit upon tenures burgage,\n  And one on tithes, which sure are Discord's torches,\nKindling Religion till she throws down her gage,\n  'Untying' squires 'to fight against the churches;'\nThere was a prize ox, a prize pig, and ploughman,\nFor Henry was a sort of Sabine showman.\n\nThere were two poachers caught in a steel trap,\n  Ready for gaol, their place of convalescence;\nThere was a country girl in a close cap\n  And scarlet cloak (I hate the sight to see, since—\nSince—since—in youth, I had the sad mishap—\n  But luckily I have paid few parish fees since):\nThat scarlet cloak, alas! unclosed with rigour,\nPresents the problem of a double figure.\n\nA reel within a bottle is a mystery,\n  One can't tell how it e'er got in or out;\nTherefore the present piece of natural history\n  I leave to those who are fond of solving doubt;\nAnd merely state, though not for the consistory,\n  Lord Henry was a justice, and that Scout\nThe constable, beneath a warrant's banner,\nHad bagg'd this poacher upon Nature's manor.\n\nNow justices of peace must judge all pieces\n  Of mischief of all kinds, and keep the game\nAnd morals of the country from caprices\n  Of those who have not a license for the same;\nAnd of all things, excepting tithes and leases,\n  Perhaps these are most difficult to tame:\nPreserving partridges and pretty wenches\nAre puzzles to the most precautious benches.\n\nThe present culprit was extremely pale,\n  Pale as if painted so; her cheek being red\nBy nature, as in higher dames less hale\n  'T is white, at least when they just rise from bed.\nPerhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail,\n  Poor soul! for she was country born and bred,\nAnd knew no better in her immorality\nThan to wax white—for blushes are for quality.\n\nHer black, bright, downcast, yet espiegle eye,\n  Had gather'd a large tear into its corner,\nWhich the poor thing at times essay'd to dry,\n  For she was not a sentimental mourner\nParading all her sensibility,\n  Nor insolent enough to scorn the scorner,\nBut stood in trembling, patient tribulation,\nTo be call'd up for her examination.\n\nOf course these groups were scatter'd here and there,\n  Not nigh the gay saloon of ladies gent.\nThe lawyers in the study; and in air\n  The prize pig, ploughman, poachers; the men sent\nFrom town, viz., architect and dealer, were\n  Both busy (as a general in his tent\nWriting despatches) in their several stations,\nExulting in their brilliant lucubrations.\n\nBut this poor girl was left in the great hall,\n  While Scout, the parish guardian of the frail,\nDiscuss'd (he hated beer yclept the 'small')\n  A mighty mug of moral double ale.\nShe waited until justice could recall\n  Its kind attentions to their proper pale,\nTo name a thing in nomenclature rather\nPerplexing for most virgins—a child's father.\n\nYou see here was enough of occupation\n  For the Lord Henry, link'd with dogs and horses.\nThere was much bustle too, and preparation\n  Below stairs on the score of second courses;\nBecause, as suits their rank and situation,\n  Those who in counties have great land resources\nHave 'Public days,' when all men may carouse,\nThough not exactly what 's call'd 'open house.'\n\nBut once a week or fortnight, uninvited\n  (Thus we translate a general invitation),\nAll country gentlemen, esquired or knighted,\n  May drop in without cards, and take their station\nAt the full board, and sit alike delighted\n  With fashionable wines and conversation;\nAnd, as the isthmus of the grand connection,\nTalk o'er themselves the past and next election.\n\nLord Henry was a great electioneerer,\n  Burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit;\nBut county contests cost him rather dearer,\n  Because the neighbouring Scotch Earl of Giftgabbit\nHad English influence in the self-same sphere here;\n  His son, the Honourable Dick Dicedrabbit,\nWas member for the 'other interest' (meaning\nThe same self-interest, with a different leaning).\n\nCourteous and cautious therefore in his county,\n  He was all things to all men, and dispensed\nTo some civility, to others bounty,\n  And promises to all—which last commenced\nTo gather to a somewhat large amount, he\n  Not calculating how much they condensed;\nBut what with keeping some, and breaking others,\nHis word had the same value as another's.\n\nA friend to freedom and freeholders—yet\n  No less a friend to government—he held,\nThat he exactly the just medium hit\n  'Twixt place and patriotism—albeit compell'd,\nSuch was his sovereign's pleasure (though unfit,\n  He added modestly, when rebels rail'd),\nTo hold some sinecures he wish'd abolish'd,\nBut that with them all law would be demolish'd.\n\nHe was 'free to confess' (whence comes this phrase?\n  Is 't English? No—'t is only parliamentary)\nThat innovation's spirit now-a-days\n  Had made more progress than for the last century.\nHe would not tread a factious path to praise,\n  Though for the public weal disposed to venture high;\nAs for his place, he could but say this of it,\nThat the fatigue was greater than the profit.\n\nHeaven, and his friends, knew that a private life\n  Had ever been his sole and whole ambition;\nBut could he quit his king in times of strife,\n  Which threaten'd the whole country with perdition?\nWhen demagogues would with a butcher's knife\n  Cut through and through (oh! damnable incision!)\nThe Gordian or the Geordi-an knot, whose strings\nHave tied together commons, lords, and kings.\n\nSooner 'come lace into the civil list\n  And champion him to the utmost'—he would keep it,\nTill duly disappointed or dismiss'd:\n  Profit he care not for, let others reap it;\nBut should the day come when place ceased to exist,\n  The country would have far more cause to weep it:\nFor how could it go on? Explain who can!\nHe gloried in the name of Englishman.\n\nHe was as independent—ay, much more—\n  Than those who were not paid for independence,\nAs common soldiers, or a common—shore,\n  Have in their several arts or parts ascendance\nO'er the irregulars in lust or gore,\n  Who do not give professional attendance.\nThus on the mob all statesmen are as eager\nTo prove their pride, as footmen to a beggar.\n\nAll this (save the last stanza) Henry said,\n  And thought. I say no more—I 've said too much;\nFor all of us have either heard or read—\n  Off—or upon the hustings—some slight such\nHints from the independent heart or head\n  Of the official candidate. I 'll touch\nNo more on this—the dinner-bell hath rung,\nAnd grace is said; the grace I should have sung—\n\nBut I 'm too late, and therefore must make play.\n  'T was a great banquet, such as Albion old\nWas wont to boast—as if a glutton's tray\n  Were something very glorious to behold.\nBut 't was a public feast and public day,—\n  Quite full, right dull, guests hot, and dishes cold,\nGreat plenty, much formality, small cheer,\nAnd every body out of their own sphere.\n\nThe squires familiarly formal, and\n  My lords and ladies proudly condescending;\nThe very servants puzzling how to hand\n  Their plates—without it might be too much bending\nFrom their high places by the sideboard's stand—\n  Yet, like their masters, fearful of offending.\nFor any deviation from the graces\nMight cost both man and master too—their places.\n\nThere were some hunters bold, and coursers keen,\n  Whose hounds ne'er err'd, nor greyhounds deign'd to lurch;\nSome deadly shots too, Septembrizers, seen\n  Earliest to rise, and last to quit the search\nOf the poor partridge through his stubble screen.\n  There were some massy members of the church,\nTakers of tithes, and makers of good matches,\nAnd several who sung fewer psalms than catches.\n\nThere were some country wags too—and, alas!\n  Some exiles from the town, who had been driven\nTo gaze, instead of pavement, upon grass,\n  And rise at nine in lieu of long eleven.\nAnd lo! upon that day it came to pass,\n  I sate next that o'erwhelming son of heaven,\nThe very powerful parson, Peter Pith,\nThe loudest wit I e'er was deafen'd with.\n\nI knew him in his livelier London days,\n  A brilliant diner out, though but a curate;\nAnd not a joke he cut but earn'd its praise,\n  Until preferment, coming at a sure rate\n(O Providence! how wondrous are thy ways!\n  Who would suppose thy gifts sometimes obdurate?),\nGave him, to lay the devil who looks o'er Lincoln,\nA fat fen vicarage, and nought to think on.\n\nHis jokes were sermons, and his sermons jokes;\n  But both were thrown away amongst the fens;\nFor wit hath no great friend in aguish folks.\n  No longer ready ears and short-hand pens\nImbibed the gay bon-mot, or happy hoax:\n  The poor priest was reduced to common sense,\nOr to coarse efforts very loud and long,\nTo hammer a horse laugh from the thick throng.\n\nThere is a difference, says the song, 'between\n  A beggar and a queen,' or was (of late\nThe latter worse used of the two we 've seen—\n  But we 'll say nothing of affairs of state);\nA difference ''twixt a bishop and a dean,'\n  A difference between crockery ware and plate,\nAs between English beef and Spartan broth—\nAnd yet great heroes have been bred by both.\n\nBut of all nature's discrepancies, none\n  Upon the whole is greater than the difference\nBeheld between the country and the town,\n  Of which the latter merits every preference\nFrom those who have few resources of their own,\n  And only think, or act, or feel, with reference\nTo some small plan of interest or ambition—\nBoth which are limited to no condition.\n\nBut 'en avant!' The light loves languish o'er\n  Long banquets and too many guests, although\nA slight repast makes people love much more,\n  Bacchus and Ceres being, as we know\nEven from our grammar upwards, friends of yore\n  With vivifying Venus, who doth owe\nTo these the invention of champagne and truffles:\nTemperance delights her, but long fasting ruffles.\n\nDully past o'er the dinner of the day;\n  And Juan took his place, he knew not where,\nConfused, in the confusion, and distrait,\n  And sitting as if nail'd upon his chair:\nThough knives and forks clank'd round as in a fray,\n  He seem'd unconscious of all passing there,\nTill some one, with a groan, exprest a wish\n(Unheeded twice) to have a fin of fish.\n\nOn which, at the third asking of the bans,\n  He started; and perceiving smiles around\nBroadening to grins, he colour'd more than once,\n  And hastily—as nothing can confound\nA wise man more than laughter from a dunce—\n  Inflicted on the dish a deadly wound,\nAnd with such hurry, that ere he could curb it\nHe had paid his neighbour's prayer with half a turbot.\n\nThis was no bad mistake, as it occurr'd,\n  The supplicator being an amateur;\nBut others, who were left with scarce a third,\n  Were angry—as they well might, to be sure.\nThey wonder'd how a young man so absurd\n  Lord Henry at his table should endure;\nAnd this, and his not knowing how much oats\nHad fallen last market, cost his host three votes.\n\nThey little knew, or might have sympathised,\n  That he the night before had seen a ghost,\nA prologue which but slightly harmonised\n  With the substantial company engross'd\nBy matter, and so much materialised,\n  That one scarce knew at what to marvel most\nOf two things—how (the question rather odd is)\nSuch bodies could have souls, or souls such bodies.\n\nBut what confused him more than smile or stare\n  From all the 'squires and 'squiresses around,\nWho wonder'd at the abstraction of his air,\n  Especially as he had been renown'd\nFor some vivacity among the fair,\n  Even in the country circle's narrow bound\n(For little things upon my lord's estate\nWere good small talk for others still less great)—\n\nWas, that he caught Aurora's eye on his,\n  And something like a smile upon her cheek.\nNow this he really rather took amiss:\n  In those who rarely smile, their smiles bespeak\nA strong external motive; and in this\n  Smile of Aurora's there was nought to pique\nOr hope, or love, with any of the wiles\nWhich some pretend to trace in ladies' smiles.\n\n'T was a mere quiet smile of contemplation,\n  Indicative of some surprise and pity;\nAnd Juan grew carnation with vexation,\n  Which was not very wise, and still less witty,\nSince he had gain'd at least her observation,\n  A most important outwork of the city—\nAs Juan should have known, had not his senses\nBy last night's ghost been driven from their defences.\n\nBut what was bad, she did not blush in turn,\n  Nor seem embarrass'd—quite the contrary;\nHer aspect was as usual, still—not stern—\n  And she withdrew, but cast not down, her eye,\nYet grew a little pale—with what? concern?\n  I know not; but her colour ne'er was high—\nThough sometimes faintly flush'd—and always clear,\nAs deep seas in a sunny atmosphere.\n\nBut Adeline was occupied by fame\n  This day; and watching, witching, condescending\nTo the consumers of fish, fowl, and game,\n  And dignity with courtesy so blending,\nAs all must blend whose part it is to aim\n  (Especially as the sixth year is ending)\nAt their lord's, son's, or similar connection's\nSafe conduct through the rocks of re-elections.\n\nThough this was most expedient on the whole,\n  And usual—Juan, when he cast a glance\nOn Adeline while playing her grand role,\n  Which she went through as though it were a dance,\nBetraying only now and then her soul\n  By a look scarce perceptibly askance\n(Of weariness or scorn), began to feel\nSome doubt how much of Adeline was real;\n\nSo well she acted all and every part\n  By turns—with that vivacious versatility,\nWhich many people take for want of heart.\n  They err—'t is merely what is call'd mobility,\nA thing of temperament and not of art,\n  Though seeming so, from its supposed facility;\nAnd false—though true; for surely they 're sincerest\nWho are strongly acted on by what is nearest.\n\nThis makes your actors, artists, and romancers,\n  Heroes sometimes, though seldom—sages never;\nBut speakers, bards, diplomatists, and dancers,\n  Little that 's great, but much of what is clever;\nMost orators, but very few financiers,\n  Though all Exchequer chancellors endeavour,\nOf late years, to dispense with Cocker's rigours,\nAnd grow quite figurative with their figures.\n\nThe poets of arithmetic are they\n  Who, though they prove not two and two to be\nFive, as they might do in a modest way,\n  Have plainly made it out that four are three,\nJudging by what they take, and what they pay.\n  The Sinking Fund's unfathomable sea,\nThat most unliquidating liquid, leaves\nThe debt unsunk, yet sinks all it receives.\n\nWhile Adeline dispensed her airs and graces,\n  The fair Fitz-Fulke seem'd very much at ease;\nThough too well bred to quiz men to their faces,\n  Her laughing blue eyes with a glance could seize\nThe ridicules of people in all places—\n  That honey of your fashionable bees—\nAnd store it up for mischievous enjoyment;\nAnd this at present was her kind employment.\n\nHowever, the day closed, as days must close;\n  The evening also waned—and coffee came.\nEach carriage was announced, and ladies rose,\n  And curtsying off, as curtsies country dame,\nRetired: with most unfashionable bows\n  Their docile esquires also did the same,\nDelighted with their dinner and their host,\nBut with the Lady Adeline the most.\n\nSome praised her beauty; others her great grace;\n  The warmth of her politeness, whose sincerity\nWas obvious in each feature of her face,\n  Whose traits were radiant with the rays of verity.\nYes; she was truly worthy her high place!\n  No one could envy her deserved prosperity.\nAnd then her dress—what beautiful simplicity\nDraperied her form with curious felicity!\n\nMeanwhile Sweet Adeline deserved their praises,\n  By an impartial indemnification\nFor all her past exertion and soft phrases,\n  In a most edifying conversation,\nWhich turn'd upon their late guests' miens and faces,\n  And families, even to the last relation;\nTheir hideous wives, their horrid selves and dresses,\nAnd truculent distortion of their tresses.\n\nTrue, she said little—'t was the rest that broke\n  Forth into universal epigram;\nBut then 't was to the purpose what she spoke:\n  Like Addison's 'faint praise,' so wont to damn,\nHer own but served to set off every joke,\n  As music chimes in with a melodrame.\nHow sweet the task to shield an absent friend!\nI ask but this of mine, to—not defend.\n\nThere were but two exceptions to this keen\n  Skirmish of wits o'er the departed; one\nAurora, with her pure and placid mien;\n  And Juan, too, in general behind none\nIn gay remark on what he had heard or seen,\n  Sate silent now, his usual spirits gone:\nIn vain he heard the others rail or rally,\nHe would not join them in a single sally.\n\n'T is true he saw Aurora look as though\n  She approved his silence; she perhaps mistook\nIts motive for that charity we owe\n  But seldom pay the absent, nor would look\nFarther—it might or might not be so.\n  But Juan, sitting silent in his nook,\nObserving little in his reverie,\nYet saw this much, which he was glad to see.\n\nThe ghost at least had done him this much good,\n  In making him as silent as a ghost,\nIf in the circumstances which ensued\n  He gain'd esteem where it was worth the most.\nAnd certainly Aurora had renew'd\n  In him some feelings he had lately lost,\nOr harden'd; feelings which, perhaps ideal,\nAre so divine, that I must deem them real:—\n\nThe love of higher things and better days;\n  The unbounded hope, and heavenly ignorance\nOf what is call'd the world, and the world's ways;\n  The moments when we gather from a glance\nMore joy than from all future pride or praise,\n  Which kindle manhood, but can ne'er entrance\nThe heart in an existence of its own,\nOf which another's bosom is the zone.\n\nWho would not sigh Ai ai Tan Kuuerheian\n  That hath a memory, or that had a heart?\nAlas! her star must fade like that of Dian:\n  Ray fades on ray, as years on years depart.\nAnacreon only had the soul to tie an\n  Unwithering myrtle round the unblunted dart\nOf Eros: but though thou hast play'd us many tricks,\nStill we respect thee, 'Alma Venus Genetrix!'\n\nAnd full of sentiments, sublime as billows\n  Heaving between this world and worlds beyond,\nDon Juan, when the midnight hour of pillows\n  Arrived, retired to his; but to despond\nRather than rest. Instead of poppies, willows\n  Waved o'er his couch; he meditated, fond\nOf those sweet bitter thoughts which banish sleep,\nAnd make the worldling sneer, the youngling weep.\n\nThe night was as before: he was undrest,\n  Saving his night-gown, which is an undress;\nCompletely 'sans culotte,' and without vest;\n  In short, he hardly could be clothed with less:\nBut apprehensive of his spectral guest,\n  He sate with feelings awkward to express\n(By those who have not had such visitations),\nExpectant of the ghost's fresh operations.\n\nAnd not in vain he listen'd;—Hush! what 's that?\n  I see—I see—Ah, no!—'t is not—yet 't is—\nYe powers! it is the—the—the—Pooh! the cat!\n  The devil may take that stealthy pace of his!\nSo like a spiritual pit-a-pat,\n  Or tiptoe of an amatory Miss,\nGliding the first time to a rendezvous,\nAnd dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe.\n\nAgain—what is 't? The wind? No, no—this time\n  It is the sable friar as before,\nWith awful footsteps regular as rhyme,\n  Or (as rhymes may be in these days) much more.\nAgain through shadows of the night sublime,\n  When deep sleep fell on men, and the world wore\nThe starry darkness round her like a girdle\nSpangled with gems—the monk made his blood curdle.\n\nA noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,\n  Which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,\nLike showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,\n  Sounding like very supernatural water,\nCame over Juan's ear, which throbb'd, alas!\n  For immaterialism 's a serious matter;\nSo that even those whose faith is the most great\nIn souls immortal, shun them tete-a-tete.\n\nWere his eyes open?—Yes! and his mouth too.\n  Surprise has this effect—to make one dumb,\nYet leave the gate which eloquence slips through\n  As wide as if a long speech were to come.\nNigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,\n  Tremendous to a mortal tympanum:\nHis eyes were open, and (as was before\nStated) his mouth. What open'd next?—the door.\n\nIt open'd with a most infernal creak,\n  Like that of hell. 'Lasciate ogni speranza\nVoi che entrate!' The hinge seem'd to speak,\n  Dreadful as Dante's rhima, or this stanza;\nOr—but all words upon such themes are weak:\n  A single shade 's sufficient to entrance\nHero—for what is substance to a spirit?\nOr how is 't matter trembles to come near it?\n\nThe door flew wide,—not swiftly, but, as fly\n  The sea-gulls, with a steady, sober flight,\nAnd then swung back, nor close, but stood awry,\n  Half letting in long shadows on the light,\nWhich still in Juan's candlesticks burned high,\n  For he had two, both tolerably bright,\nAnd in the doorway, darkening darkness, stood\nThe sable Friar in his solemn hood.\n\nBetween two worlds life hovers like a star,\n  'Twixt night and morn, upon the horizon's verge.\nHow little do we know that which we are!\n  How less what we may be! The eternal surge\nOf time and tide rolls on, and bears afar\n  Our bubbles; as the old burst, new emerge,\nLash'd from the foam of ages; while the graves\nOf empires heave but like some passing waves.\n\nDon Juan shook, as erst he had been shaken\n  The night before, but being sick of shaking,\nHe first inclined to think he had been mistaken,\n  And then to be ashamed of such mistaking.\nHis own internal ghost began to awaken\n  Within him and to quell his corporal quaking,\nHinting that soul and body on the whole\nWere odds against a disembodied soul.\n\nAnd then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,\n  And he arose, advanced. The shade retreated,\nBut Juan, eager now the truth to pierce,\n  Followed, his veins no longer cold, but heated,\nResolved to thrust the mystery carte and tierce,\n  At whatsoever risk of being defeated.\nThe ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until\nHe reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still.\n\nJuan put forth one arm. Eternal powers!\n  It touched no soul nor body, but the wall,\nOn which the moonbeams fell in silvery showers\n  Checkered with all the tracery of the hall.\nHe shuddered, as no doubt the bravest cowers\n  When he can't tell what 'tis that doth appal.\nHow odd, a single hobgoblin's nonentity\nShould cause more fear than a whole host's identity.\n\nBut still the shade remained, the blue eyes glared,\n  And rather variably for stony death.\nYet one thing rather good the grave had spared;\n  The ghost had a remarkably sweet breath.\nA straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired.\n  A red lip with two rows of pearls beneath\nGleamed forth, as through the casement's ivy shroud\nThe moon peeped, just escaped from a grey cloud.\n\nAnd Juan, puzzled but still curious, thrust\n  His other arm forth. Wonder upon wonder!\nIt pressed upon a hard but glowing bust,\n Which beat as if there was a warm heart under.\nHe found, as people on most trials must,\n  That he had made at first a silly blunder\nAnd that in his confusion he had caught\nOnly the wall, instead of what he sought\n\nThe ghost, if ghost it were, seemed a sweet soul\n  As ever lurked beneath a holy hood.\nA dimpled chin, a neck of ivory stole\n  Forth into something much like flesh and blood.\nBack fell the sable frock and dreary cowl\n  And they revealed, alas, that ere they should,\nIn full, voluptuous, but not o'ergrown bulk,\nThe phantom of her frolic Grace—Fitz-Fulke!</code>"
