And store it up for mischievous enjoyment;
And this at present was her kind employment.

However, the day closed, as days must close;
  The evening also waned—and coffee came.
Each carriage was announced, and ladies rose,
  And curtsying off, as curtsies country dame,
Retired: with most unfashionable bows
  Their docile esquires also did the same,
Delighted with their dinner and their host,
But with the Lady Adeline the most.

Some praised her beauty; others her great grace;
  The warmth of her politeness, whose sincerity
Was obvious in each feature of her face,
  Whose traits were radiant with the rays of verity.
Yes; she was truly worthy her high place!
