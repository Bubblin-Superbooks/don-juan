But aggravate the crime you have not prevented,
By rendering desperate those who had else repented.

But Juan was no casuist, nor had ponder'd
  Upon the moral lessons of mankind:
Besides, he had not seen of several hundred
  A lady altogether to his mind.
A little 'blase'—'t is not to be wonder'd
  At, that his heart had got a tougher rind:
And though not vainer from his past success,
No doubt his sensibilities were less.

He also had been busy seeing sights—
  The Parliament and all the other houses;
Had sat beneath the gallery at nights,
  To hear debates whose thunder roused (not rouses)
The world to gaze upon those northern lights
