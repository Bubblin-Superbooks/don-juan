The very tendon which is most acute
  (That which some ancient Muse or modern wit
Named after thee, Achilles), and quite through 't
  He made the teeth meet, nor relinquish'd it
Even with his life—for (but they lie) 't is said
To the live leg still clung the sever'd head.

However this may be, 't is pretty sure
  The Russian officer for life was lamed,
For the Turk's teeth stuck faster than a skewer,
  And left him 'midst the invalid and maim'd:
The regimental surgeon could not cure
  His patient, and perhaps was to be blamed
More than the head of the inveterate foe,
Which was cut off, and scarce even then let go.

But then the fact 's a fact—and 't is the part
