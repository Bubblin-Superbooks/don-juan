Named from her mystic office 'l'Eprouveuse,'
A term inexplicable to the Muse.

With her then, as in humble duty bound,
  Juan retired,â€”and so will I, until
My Pegasus shall tire of touching ground.
  We have just lit on a 'heaven-kissing hill,'
So lofty that I feel my brain turn round,
  And all my fancies whirling like a mill;
Which is a signal to my nerves and brain,
To take a quiet ride in some green Lane.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
