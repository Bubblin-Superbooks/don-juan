<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Requires it, that 's to say, the English rhyme,
And not the pink of old hexameters;
  But, after all, there 's neither tune nor time
In the last line, which cannot well be worse,
  And was thrust in to close the octave's chime:
I own no prosody can ever rate it
As a rule, but truth may, if you translate it.

If fair Gulbeyaz overdid her part,
  I know not—it succeeded, and success
Is much in most things, not less in the heart
  Than other articles of female dress.
Self-love in man, too, beats all female art;
  They lie, we lie, all lie, but love no less;
And no one virtue yet, except starvation,
Could stop that worst of vices—propagation.

We leave this royal couple to repose:
