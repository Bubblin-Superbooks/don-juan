<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">now,
And then I 'm with you, if you 're for a row.'

Some talk of an appeal unto some passion,
  Some to men's feelings, others to their reason;
The last of these was never much the fashion,
  For reason thinks all reasoning out of season.
Some speakers whine, and others lay the lash on,
  But more or less continue still to tease on,
With arguments according to their 'forte;'
But no one dreams of ever being short.-

But I digress: of all appeals,—although
  I grant the power of pathos, and of gold,
Of beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling,—no
  Method 's more sure at moments to take hold
Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow
  More tender, as we every day</pre></div> </div>
