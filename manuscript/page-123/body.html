(But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)
  That this is not a moral tale, though gay;
Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show
The very place where wicked people go.

If, after all, there should be some so blind
  To their own good this warning to despise,
Led by some tortuosity of mind,
  Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,
And cry that they 'the moral cannot find,'
  I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;
Should captains the remark, or critics, make,
They also lie tooâ€”under a mistake.

The public approbation I expect,
  And beg they 'll take my word about the moral,
Which I with their amusement will connect
