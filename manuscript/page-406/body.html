<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Upon the metamorphosis in view,—
'Farewell!' they mutually exclaim'd: 'this soil
  Seems fertile in adventures strange and new;
One 's turn'd half Mussulman, and one a maid,
By this old black enchanter's unsought aid.'

'Farewell!' said Juan: 'should we meet no more,
  I wish you a good appetite.'—'Farewell!'
Replied the other; 'though it grieves me sore;
  When we next meet we 'll have a tale to tell:
We needs must follow when Fate puts from shore.
  Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell.'
'Nay,' quoth the maid, 'the Sultan's self shan't carry me,
Unless his highness promises to marry me.

And thus they parted, each by separate doors;
  Baba led Juan onward room by room
Through glittering galleries and o'er marble floors,
