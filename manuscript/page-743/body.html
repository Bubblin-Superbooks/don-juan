<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Poor fellow! His was an untoward fate;
'T is strange the mind, that very fiery particle,
Should let itself be snuff'd out by an article.

The list grows long of live and dead pretenders
  To that which none will gain—or none will know
The conqueror at least; who, ere Time renders
  His last award, will have the long grass grow
Above his burnt-out brain, and sapless cinders.
  If I might augur, I should rate but low
Their chances; they 're too numerous, like the thirty
Mock tyrants, when Rome's annals wax'd but dirty.

This is the literary lower empire,
  Where the praetorian bands take up the matter;—
A 'dreadful trade,' like his who 'gathers samphire,'
  The insolent soldiery to soothe and flatter,
With the same feelings as you 'd coax a vampire.
