<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And thy pure creed made sanction of all ill?
Redeeming worlds to be by bigots shaken,
  How was thy toil rewarded? We might fill
Volumes with similar sad illustrations,
But leave them to the conscience of the nations.

I perch upon an humbler promontory,
  Amidst life's infinite variety:
With no great care for what is nicknamed glory,
  But speculating as I cast mine eye
On what may suit or may not suit my story,
  And never straining hard to versify,
I rattle on exactly as I 'd talk
With any body in a ride or walk.

I don't know that there may be much ability
  Shown in this sort of desultory rhyme;
But there 's a conversational facility,
