<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Of yellow casimere we may presume,
White stocking drawn uncurdled as new milk
O'er limbs whose symmetry set off the silk;

Suppose him sword by side, and hat in hand,
  Made up by youth, fame, and an army tailor—
That great enchanter, at whose rod's command
  Beauty springs forth, and Nature's self turns paler,
Seeing how Art can make her work more grand
  (When she don't pin men's limbs in like a gaoler),—
Behold him placed as if upon a pillar! He
Seems Love turn'd a lieutenant of artillery:—

His bandage slipp'd down into a cravat;
  His wings subdued to epaulettes; his quiver
Shrunk to a scabbard, with his arrows at
  His side as a small sword, but sharp as ever;
His bow converted into a cock'd hat;
