<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">But now I can't tell where it may not run.
No doubt, if I had wish' to pay my court
  To critics, or to hail the setting sun
Of tyranny of all kinds, my concision
Were more;â€”but I was born for opposition.

But then 't is mostly on the weaker side;
  So that I verily believe if they
Who now are basking in their full-blown pride
  Were shaken down, and 'dogs had had their day,'
Though at the first I might perchance deride
  Their tumble, I should turn the other way,
And wax an ultra-royalist in loyalty,
Because I hate even democratic royalty.

I think I should have made a decent spouse,
  If I had never proved the soft condition;
I think I should have made monastic vows,
