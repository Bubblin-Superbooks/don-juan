But tugging on his petticoat, he tripp'd,
  Which—as we say—or, as the Scotch say, whilk
(The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes
Monarchs are less imperative than rhymes)—

Whilk, which (or what you please), was owing to
  His garment's novelty, and his being awkward:
And yet at last he managed to get through
  His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:
The negro Baba help'd a little too,
  When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;
And, wrestling both his arms into a gown,
He paused, and took a survey up and down.

One difficulty still remain'd—his hair
  Was hardly long enough; but Baba found
So many false long tresses all to spare,
