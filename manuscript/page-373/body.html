<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">'T is not my present lot, as I have said,
Which I deplore so much; for I have borne
Hardships which have the hardiest overworn,

'On the rough deep. But this last blow-' and here
  He stopp'd again, and turn'd away his face.
'Ay,' quoth his friend, 'I thought it would appear
  That there had been a lady in the case;
And these are things which ask a tender tear,
  Such as I, too, would shed if in your place:
I cried upon my first wife's dying day,
And also when my second ran away:

'My third-'—'Your third!' quoth Juan, turning round;
  'You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?'
'No—only two at present above ground:
  Surely 't is nothing wonderful to see
One person thrice in holy wedlock bound!'
