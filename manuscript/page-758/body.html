Against the same given quantity of rhyme,
  For being as much the subject of attack
As ever yet was any work sublime,
  By those who love to say that white is black.
So much the better!â€”I may stand alone,
But would not change my free thoughts for a throne.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
