<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Of wonderful replies from Arab jokers,
Of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,
  Of rocks bewitch'd that open to the knockers,
Of magic ladies who, by one sole act,
Transform'd their lords to beasts (but that 's a fact).

Here was no lack of innocent diversion
  For the imagination or the senses,
Song, dance, wine, music, stories from the Persian,
  All pretty pastimes in which no offence is;
But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,
  Perceiving in his absence such expenses,
Dreading that climax of all human ills,
The inflammation of his weekly bills.

Ah! what is man? what perils still environ
  The happiest mortals even after dinnerâ€”
A day of gold from out an age of iron
