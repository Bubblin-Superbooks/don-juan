O, world! which was and is, what is cosmogony?
  Some people have accused me of misanthropy;
And yet I know no more than the mahogany
  That forms this desk, of what they mean; lykanthropy
I comprehend, for without transformation
Men become wolves on any slight occasion.

But I, the mildest, meekest of mankind,
  Like Moses, or Melancthon, who have ne'er
Done anything exceedingly unkind,—
  And (though I could not now and then forbear
Following the bent of body or of mind)
  Have always had a tendency to spare,—
Why do they call me misanthrope? Because
They hate me, not I them.—and here we 'll pause.
