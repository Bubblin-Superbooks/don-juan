What say you, child?'—Dudu said nothing, as
Her talents were of the more silent class;

But she rose up, and kiss'd the matron's brow
  Between the eyes, and Lolah on both cheeks,
Katinka, too; and with a gentle bow
  (Curt'sies are neither used by Turks nor Greeks)
She took Juanna by the hand to show
  Their place of rest, and left to both their piques,
The others pouting at the matron's preference
Of Dudu, though they held their tongues from deference.

It was a spacious chamber (Oda is
  The Turkish title), and ranged round the wall
Were couches, toilets—and much more than this
  I might describe, as I have seen it</pre></div> </div>
