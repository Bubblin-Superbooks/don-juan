<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">My topic, with of course the due restriction
Which is required by proper courtesy;
  And recollect the work is only fiction,
And that I sing of neither mine nor me,
  Though every scribe, in some slight turn of diction,
Will hint allusions never meant. Ne'er doubt

Whether he married with the third or fourth
  Offspring of some sage husband-hunting countess,
Or whether with some virgin of more worth
  (I mean in Fortune's matrimonial bounties)
He took to regularly peopling Earth,
  Of which your lawful awful wedlock fount is,—
Or whether he was taken in for damages,
For being too excursive in his homages,—

Is yet within the unread events of time.
