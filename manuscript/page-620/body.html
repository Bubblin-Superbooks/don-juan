As we now gaze upon the mammoth's bones,
  'And wonder what old world such things could see,
Or hieroglyphics on Egyptian stones,
  The pleasant riddles of futurity—
Guessing at what shall happily be hid,
As the real purpose of a pyramid.

Reader! I have kept my word,—at least so far
  As the first Canto promised. You have now
Had sketches of love, tempest, travel, war—
  All very accurate, you must allow,
And epic, if plain truth should prove no bar;
  For I have drawn much less with a long bow
Than my forerunners. Carelessly I sing,
But Phoebus lends me now and then a string,

With which I still can harp, and carp, and fiddle.
