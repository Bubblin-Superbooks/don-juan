Their goods and edicts out from pole to pole,
And made the very billows pay them toll.

I 've no great cause to love that spot of earth,
  Which holds what might have been the noblest nation;
But though I owe it little but my birth,
  I feel a mix'd regret and veneration
For its decaying fame and former worth.
  Seven years (the usual term of transportation)
Of absence lay one's old resentments level,
When a man's country 's going to the devil.

Alas! could she but fully, truly, know
  How her great name is now throughout abhorr'd:
How eager all the earth is for the blow
  Which shall lay bare her bosom to the sword;
How all the nations deem her their worst foe,
