<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Conduct like this by no means comprehends;
Revenge in person 's certainly no virtue,
But then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you.

And if your quarrels should rip up old stories,
  And help them with a lie or two additional,
I 'm not to blame, as you well know—no more is
  Any one else—they were become traditional;
Besides, their resurrection aids our glories
  By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:
And science profits by this resurrection—
Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.

Their friends had tried at reconciliation,
  Then their relations, who made matters worse.
('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion
  To whom it may be best to have recourse—
I can't say much for friend or yet relation):
