To this grey ruin, with a voice to charm.
  Sad, but serene, it sweeps o'er tree or tower;
The cause I know not, nor can solve; but such
The fact:—I 've heard it—once perhaps too much.

Amidst the court a Gothic fountain play'd,
  Symmetrical, but deck'd with carvings quaint—
Strange faces, like to men in masquerade,
  And here perhaps a monster, there a saint:
The spring gush'd through grim mouths of granite made,
  And sparkled into basins, where it spent
Its little torrent in a thousand bubbles,
Like man's vain glory, and his vainer troubles.

The mansion's self was vast and venerable,
  With more of the monastic than has</pre></div> </div>
