But rarely seen, like gold compared with paper.
And did he see this? or was it a vapour?

Once, twice, thrice pass'd, repass'd—the thing of air,
  Or earth beneath, or heaven, or t' other place;
And Juan gazed upon it with a stare,
  Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base
As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair
  Twine like a knot of snakes around his face;
He tax'd his tongue for words, which were not granted,
To ask the reverend person what he wanted.

The third time, after a still longer pause,
  The shadow pass'd away—but where? the hall
Was long, and thus far there was no great cause
  To think his vanishing unnatural:
Doors there were many, through which, by the laws
