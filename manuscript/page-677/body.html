Don Juan, who was real, or ideal,—
  For both are much the same, since what men think
Exists when the once thinkers are less real
  Than what they thought, for mind can never sink,
And 'gainst the body makes a strong appeal;
  And yet 't is very puzzling on the brink
Of what is call'd eternity, to stare,
And know no more of what is here, than there;—

Don Juan grew a very polish'd Russian—
  How we won't mention, why we need not say:
Few youthful minds can stand the strong concussion
  Of any slight temptation in their way;
But his just now were spread as is a cushion
  Smooth'd for a monarch's seat of honour; gay
Damsels, and dances, revels, ready</pre></div> </div>
