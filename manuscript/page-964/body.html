I say I do believe a haunted spot
  Exists—and where? That shall I not recall,
Because I 'd rather it should be forgot,

  And now and then a nightingale) is dim,
And the loud shriek of sage Minerva's fowl
  Rattles around me her discordant hymn:
Old portraits from old walls upon me scowl—
  I wish to heaven they would not look so grim;
The dying embers dwindle in the grate—
I think too that I have sate up too late:

And therefore, though 't is by no means my way
