<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Don Juan at his hands, and information
Of what had pass'd since all the slaves retired,
  And whether he had occupied their station;
If matters had been managed as desired,
  And his disguise with due consideration
Kept up; and above all, the where and how
He had pass'd the night, was what she wish'd to know.

Baba, with some embarrassment, replied
  To this long catechism of questions, ask'd
More easily than answer'd,â€”that he had tried
  His best to obey in what he had been task'd;
But there seem'd something that he wish'd to hide,
  Which hesitation more betray'd than mask'd;
He scratch'd his ear, the infallible resource
To which embarrass'd people have recourse.
