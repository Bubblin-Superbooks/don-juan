So much, he always doubted I was married—
How sorry you will be when I 've miscarried!

'Was it for this that no Cortejo e'er
  I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?
Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,
  Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?
Is it for this, whate'er my suitors were,
  I favor'd none—nay, was almost uncivil?

  Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?
Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,
  Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?
Were there not also Russians, English, many?
