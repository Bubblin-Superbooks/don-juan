Their union was a model to behold,
Serene and noble,â€”conjugal, but cold.

There was no great disparity of years,
  Though much in temper; but they never clash'd:
They moved like stars united in their spheres,
  Or like the Rhone by Leman's waters wash'd,
Where mingled and yet separate appears
  The river from the lake, all bluely dash'd
Through the serene and placid glassy deep,
Which fain would lull its river-child to sleep.

Now when she once had ta'en an interest
  In any thing, however she might flatter
Herself that her intentions were the best,
  Intense intentions are a dangerous matter:
Impressions were much stronger than she guess'd,
