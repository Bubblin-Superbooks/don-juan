<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Examples may be found of such pursuits:
Though several also keep their perpendicular
  Like poplars, with good principles for roots;
Yet many have a method more reticular—
  'Fishers for men,' like sirens with soft lutes:
For talk six times with the same single lady,
And you may get the wedding dresses ready.

Perhaps you 'll have a letter from the mother,
  To say her daughter's feelings are trepann'd;
Perhaps you 'll have a visit from the brother,
  All strut, and stays, and whiskers, to demand
What 'your intentions are?'—One way or other
  It seems the virgin's heart expects your hand:
And between pity for her case and yours,
You 'll add to Matrimony's list of cures.

I 've known a dozen weddings made even thus,
