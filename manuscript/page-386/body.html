<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">How get out? how the devil got we in?
And when we once were fairly out, and when
  From Saint Bartholomew we have saved our skin,
To-morrow 'd see us in some other den,
  And worse off than we hitherto have been;
Besides, I 'm hungry, and just now would take,
Like Esau, for my birthright a beef-steak.

'We must be near some place of man's abode;—
  For the old negro's confidence in creeping,
With his two captives, by so queer a road,
  Shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping;
A single cry would bring them all abroad:
  'T is therefore better looking before leaping—
And there, you see, this turn has brought us through,
By Jove, a noble palace!—lighted</pre></div> </div>
