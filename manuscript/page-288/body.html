<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?
      Of two such lessons, why forget
        The nobler and the manlier one?
      You have the letters Cadmus gave—
      Think ye he meant them for a slave?

      Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
        We will not think of themes like these!
      It made Anacreon's song divine:
        He served—but served Polycrates—
      A tyrant; but our masters then
      Were still, at least, our countrymen.

      The tyrant of the Chersonese
        Was freedom's best and bravest friend;
      That tyrant was Miltiades!
        O! that the present hour would lend
      Another despot of the kind!
