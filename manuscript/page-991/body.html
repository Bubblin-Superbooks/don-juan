For a spoil'd carpet—but the 'Attic Bee'
Was much consoled by his own repartee.

Thus Adeline would throw into the shade
  (By doing easily, whene'er she chose,
What dilettanti do with vast parade)
  Their sort of half profession; for it grows
To something like this when too oft display'd;
  And that it is so everybody knows
Who have heard Miss That or This, or Lady T'other,
Show off—to please their company or mother.

O! the long evenings of duets and trios!
  The admirations and the speculations;
The 'Mamma Mia's!' and the 'Amor Mio's!'
  The 'Tanti palpiti's' on such occasions:
The 'Lasciami's,' and quavering 'Addio's!'
