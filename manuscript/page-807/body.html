Also because the figure and the face
Hint, that 't is time to give the younger place.

I know that some would fain postpone this era,
  Reluctant as all placemen to resign
Their post; but theirs is merely a chimera,
  For they have pass'd life's equinoctial line:
But then they have their claret and Madeira
  To irrigate the dryness of decline;
And county meetings, and the parliament,
And debt, and what not, for their solace sent.

And is there not religion, and reform,
  Peace, war, the taxes, and what 's call'd the 'Nation'?
The struggle to be pilots in a storm?
  The landed and the monied speculation?
The joys of mutual hate to keep them warm,
