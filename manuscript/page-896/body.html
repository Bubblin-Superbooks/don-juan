That time would temper Juan's faults of youth;
  That young men rarely made monastic vows;
That opposition only more attachesâ€”
But here a messenger brought in despatches:

And being of the council call'd 'the Privy,'
  Lord Henry walk'd into his cabinet,
To furnish matter for some future Livy
  To tell how he reduced the nation's debt;
And if their full contents I do not give ye,
  It is because I do not know them yet;
But I shall add them in a brief appendix,
To come between mine epic and its index.

But ere he went, he added a slight hint,
  Another gentle common-place or two,
Such as are coin'd in conversation's mint,
