<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Wet, still more disagreeable and striking;
A woman's tear-drop melts, a man's half sears,
  Like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in
His heart to force it out, for (to be shorter)
To them 't is a relief, to us a torture.

And she would have consoled, but knew not how:
  Having no equals, nothing which had e'er
Infected her with sympathy till now,
  And never having dreamt what 't was to bear
Aught of a serious, sorrowing kind, although
  There might arise some pouting petty care
To cross her brow, she wonder'd how so near
Her eyes another's eye could shed a tear.

But nature teaches more than power can spoil,
  And, when a strong although a strange sensation
Movesâ€”female hearts are such a genial soil
