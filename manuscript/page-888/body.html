His inexperience moved her gentle ruth,
And (as her junior by six weeks) his youth.

These forty days' advantage of her years—
  And hers were those which can face calculation,
Boldly referring to the list of peers
  And noble births, nor dread the enumeration—
Gave her a right to have maternal fears
  For a young gentleman's fit education,
Though she was far from that leap year, whose leap,
In female dates, strikes Time all of a heap.

The strictest in chronology and virtue
  Advance beyond, while they could pass for new.
O Time! why dost not pause? Thy scythe, so dirty
