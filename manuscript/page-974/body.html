In chisell'd stone and painted glass, and all
That time has left our fathers of their hall.

Then, as the night was clear though cold, he threw
  His chamber door wide open—and went forth
Into a gallery, of a sombre hue,
  Long, furnish'd with old pictures of great worth,
Of knights and dames heroic and chaste too,
  As doubtless should be people of high birth.
But by dim lights the portraits of the dead
Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread.

The forms of the grim knight and pictured saint
  Look living in the moon; and as you turn
Backward and forward to the echoes faint
  Of your own footsteps—voices from the urn
Appear to wake, and shadows wild and quaint
