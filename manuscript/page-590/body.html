<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And here we may remark with the historian,
You should but give few cartridges to such
  Troops as are meant to march with greatest glory on:
When matters must be carried by the touch
  Of the bright bayonet, and they all should hurry on,
They sometimes, with a hankering for existence,
Keep merely firing at a foolish distance.

A junction of the General Meknop's men
  (Without the General, who had fallen some time
Before, being badly seconded just then)
  Was made at length with those who dared to climb
The death-disgorging rampart once again;
  And though the Turk's resistance was sublime,
They took the bastion, which the Seraskier
Defended at a price extremely dear.

Juan and Johnson, and some volunteers,
