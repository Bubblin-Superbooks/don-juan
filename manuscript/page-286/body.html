<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And where are they? and where art thou,
        My country? On thy voiceless shore
      The heroic lay is tuneless now—
        The heroic bosom beats no more!
      And must thy lyre, so long divine,
      Degenerate into hands like mine?

      'T is something, in the dearth of fame,
        Though link'd among a fetter'd race,
      To feel at least a patriot's shame,
        Even as I sing, suffuse my face;
      For what is left the poet here?
      For Greeks a blush—for Greece a tear.

      Must we but weep o'er days more blest?
        Must we but blush?—Our fathers bled.
      Earth! render back from out thy breast
        A remnant of our Spartan dead!
