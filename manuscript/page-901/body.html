<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Saith Horace; the great little poet 's wrong;
His other maxim, 'Noscitur a sociis,'
  Is much more to the purpose of his song;
Though even that were sometimes too ferocious,
  Unless good company be kept too long;
But, in his teeth, whate'er their state or station,
Thrice happy they who have an occupation!

Adam exchanged his Paradise for ploughing,
  Eve made up millinery with fig leavesâ€”
The earliest knowledge from the tree so knowing,
  As far as I know, that the church receives:
And since that time it need not cost much showing,
  That many of the ills o'er which man grieves,
And still more women, spring from not employing
Some hours to make the remnant worth enjoying.

And hence high life is oft a dreary void,
