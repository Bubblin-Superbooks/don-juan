<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Live animals: an old maid of threescore
For cats and birds more penchant ne'er display'd,
Although he was not old, nor even a maid;â€”

The animals aforesaid occupied
  Their station: there were valets, secretaries,
In other vehicles; but at his side
  Sat little Leila, who survived the parries
He made 'gainst Cossacque sabres, in the wide
  Slaughter of Ismail. Though my wild Muse varies
Her note, she don't forget the infant girl
Whom he preserved, a pure and living pearl

Poor little thing! She was as fair as docile,
  And with that gentle, serious character,
As rare in living beings as a fossile
  Man, 'midst thy mouldy mammoths, 'grand Cuvier!'
Ill fitted was her ignorance to jostle
