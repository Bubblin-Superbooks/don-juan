Thine ear, if it should reach—and now rhymes wander
  Almost as far as Petersburgh and lend
A dreadful impulse to each loud meander
  Of murmuring Liberty's wide waves, which blend
Their roar even with the Baltic's—so you be
Your father's son, 'tis quite enough for me.

To call men love-begotten or proclaim
  Their mothers as the antipodes of Timon,
That hater of mankind, would be a shame,
  A libel, or whate'er you please to rhyme on:
But people's ancestors are history's game;
  And if one lady's slip could leave a crime on
All generations, I should like to know
What pedigree the best would have to show?
