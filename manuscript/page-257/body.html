<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers
His sober head, majestically tame,
  Or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers
His brow, as if in act to butt, and then
Yielding to their small hands, draws back again.

Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,
  Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,
Crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,
  The gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,
The innocence which happy childhood blesses,
  Made quite a picture of these little Greeks;
So that the philosophical beholder
Sigh'd for their sakesâ€”that they should e'er grow older.

Afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales
  To a sedate grey circle of old smokers,
Of secret treasures found in hidden vales,
