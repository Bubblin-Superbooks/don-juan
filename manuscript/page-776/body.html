'Tantaene!' Such the virtues of high station,
  Even in the hopeful Isle, whose outlet 's 'Dover!'
While the poor rich wretch, object of these cares,
Has cause to wish her sire had had male heirs.

Some are soon bagg'd, and some reject three dozen.
  'T is fine to see them scattering refusals
And wild dismay o'er every angry cousin

Such as—'Unless Miss (Blank) meant to have chosen
  Poor Frederick, why did she accord perusals
To his billets? Why waltz with him? Why, I pray,
Look yes last night, and yet say no to-day?

'Why?—Why?—Besides, Fred really was attach'd;
  'T was not her fortune—he has enough without:
The time will come she 'll wish that she had snatch'd
