A great resource to all, and ne'er denied
Till wanted; therefore Juan only sigh'd.

He sigh'd;—the next resource is the full moon,
  Where all sighs are deposited; and now
It happen'd luckily, the chaste orb shone
  As clear as such a climate will allow;
And Juan's mind was in the proper tone
  To hail her with the apostrophe—'O thou!'
Of amatory egotism the Tuism,
Which further to explain would be a truism.

But lover, poet, or astronomer,
  Shepherd, or swain, whoever may behold,
Feel some abstraction when they gaze on her:
  Great thoughts we catch from thence (besides a cold
Sometimes, unless my feelings rather err);
