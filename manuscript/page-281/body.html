So vile he 'scaped the doom which oft avenges;
  And being fluent (save indeed when fee'd ill),
He lied with such a fervour of intention—
There was no doubt he earn'd his laureate pension.

But he had genius,—when a turncoat has it,
  The 'Vates irritabilis' takes care
That without notice few full moons shall pass it;
  Even good men like to make the public stare:—
But to my subject—let me see—what was it?-
  O!—the third canto—and the pretty pair—
Their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode
Of living in their insular abode.

Their poet, a sad trimmer, but no less
  In company a very pleasant fellow,
Had been the favourite of full many a mess
