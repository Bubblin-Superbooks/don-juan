<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">For this great conqueror play'd the corporal—
Some Cossacques, hovering like hawks round a hill,
  Had met a party towards the twilight's fall,
One of whom spoke their tongue—or well or ill,
  'T was much that he was understood at all;
But whether from his voice, or speech, or manner,
They found that he had fought beneath their banner.

Whereon immediately at his request
  They brought him and his comrades to head-quarters;
Their dress was Moslem, but you might have guess'd
  That these were merely masquerading Tartars,
And that beneath each Turkish-fashion'd vest
  Lurk'd Christianity; which sometimes barters
Her inward grace for outward show, and makes
It difficult to shun some strange mistakes.
