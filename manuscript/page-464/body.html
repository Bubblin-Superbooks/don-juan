Whether there are such things as sympathies
  Without our knowledge or our approbation,
Although they could not see through his disguise,

  Extremely pure, which made them all concur
In wishing her their sister, save a few
  Who wish'd they had a brother just like her,
Whom, if they were at home in sweet Circassia,
They would prefer to Padisha or Pacha.
