<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Being long married, and thus set at large,
Had left all the accomplishments she taught her
  To be transmitted, like the Lord Mayor's barge,
To the next comer; or—as it will tell
More Muse-like—like to Cytherea's shell.

I call such things transmission; for there is
  A floating balance of accomplishment
Which forms a pedigree from Miss to Miss,
  According as their minds or backs are bent.
Some waltz; some draw; some fathom the abyss
  Of metaphysics; others are content
With music; the most moderate shine as wits;
While others have a genius turn'd for fits.

But whether fits, or wits, or harpsichords,
  Theology, fine arts, or finer stays,
May be the baits for gentlemen or lords
