<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">But I won't weep!—and so drive on, postilions!
As the smart boys spurr'd fast in their career,
  Juan admired these highways of free millions;
A country in all senses the most dear
  To foreigner or native, save some silly ones,
Who 'kick against the pricks' just at this juncture,
And for their pains get only a fresh puncture.

What a delightful thing 's a turnpike road!
  So smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving
The earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad
  Air can accomplish, with his wide wings waving.
Had such been cut in Phaeton's time, the god
  Had told his son to satisfy his craving
With the York mail;—but onward as we roll,
'Surgit amari aliquid'—the toll

Alas, how deeply painful is all payment!
