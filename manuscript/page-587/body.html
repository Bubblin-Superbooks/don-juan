<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">They knew not where, being carried by the stream
To some spot, where they lost their understanding,
  And wander'd up and down as in a dream,
Until they reach'd, as daybreak was expanding,
  That which a portal to their eyes did seem,â€”
The great and gay Koutousow might have lain
Where three parts of his column yet remain.

And scrambling round the rampart, these same troops,
  After the taking of the 'Cavalier,'
Just as Koutousow's most 'forlorn' of 'hopes'
  Took like chameleons some slight tinge of fear,
Open'd the gate call'd 'Kilia,' to the groups
  Of baffled heroes, who stood shyly near,
Sliding knee-deep in lately frozen mud,
Now thaw'd into a marsh of human blood.

The Kozacks, or, if so you please, Cossacques
