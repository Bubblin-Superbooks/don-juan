No doubt whate'er might be their former strife,
  The present weather would be much more rainy—
Tears shed into the grave of the connection
Would share most probably its resurrection.

He enter'd in the house no more his home,
  A thing to human feelings the most trying,
And harder for the heart to overcome,
  Perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;
To find our hearthstone turn'd into a tomb,
  And round its once warm precincts palely lying
The ashes of our hopes, is a deep grief,
Beyond a single gentleman's belief.

He enter'd in the house—his home no more,
  For without hearts there is no home; and felt
The solitude of passing his own door
