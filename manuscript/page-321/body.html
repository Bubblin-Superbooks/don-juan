And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,
  Pale as the foam that froth'd on his dead brow,
Which she essay'd in vain to clear (how sweet
  Were once her cares, how idle seem'd they now!),
Lay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat
  Of his quench'd heart; and the sea dirges low
Rang in her sad ears like a mermaid's song,
And that brief dream appear'd a life too long.

And gazing on the dead, she thought his face
  Faded, or alter'd into something new—
Like to her father's features, till each trace—
  More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew—
With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;
  And starting, she awoke, and what to view?
O! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she</pre></div> </div>
