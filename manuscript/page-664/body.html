Such Clytemnestra, though perhaps 't is better
That one should die, than two drag on the fetter)â€”

Love had made Catherine make each lover's fortune,
  Unlike our own half-chaste Elizabeth,
Whose avarice all disbursements did importune,
  If history, the grand liar, ever saith
The truth; and though grief her old age might shorten,
  Because she put a favourite to death,
Her vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,
And stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.

But when the levee rose, and all was bustle
  In the dissolving circle, all the nations'
Ambassadors began as 't were to hustle
  Round the young man with their congratulations.
Also the softer silks were heard to rustle
