His young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss,
  And then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew
In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,—
  Love is so very timid when 't is new:
She blush'd, and frown'd not, but she strove to speak,
And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.

The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:
  The devil 's in the moon for mischief; they
Who call'd her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon
  Their nomenclature; there is not a day,
The longest, not the twenty-first of June,
  Sees half the business in a wicked way
On which three single hours of moonshine smile—
And then she looks so modest all the while.

There is a dangerous silence in that hour,
