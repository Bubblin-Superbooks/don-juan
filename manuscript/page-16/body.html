<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Transferred to gorge upon a sister shore,
The vulgarest tool that tyranny could want,
  With just enough of talent and no more,
To lengthen fetters by another fixed
And offer poison long already mixed.

An orator of such set trash of phrase,
  Ineffably, legitimately vile,
That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,
  Nor foes—all nations—condescend to smile.
Not even a sprightly blunder's spark can blaze
  From that Ixion grindstone's ceaseless toil,
That turns and turns to give the world a notion
Of endless torments and perpetual motion.

A bungler even in its disgusting trade,
  And botching, patching, leaving still behind
Something of which its masters are afraid,
