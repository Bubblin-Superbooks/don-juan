<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">night,
When wicked wives, who love some bachelor,
  Lie down in dudgeon to sigh for the light
Of the gray morning, and look vainly for
  Its twinkle through the lattice dusky quiteâ€”
To toss, to tumble, doze, revive, and quake
Lest their too lawful bed-fellow should wake!

These are beneath the canopy of heaven,
  Also beneath the canopy of beds
Four-posted and silk curtain'd, which are given
  For rich men and their brides to lay their heads
Upon, in sheets white as what bards call 'driven
  Snow.' Well! 'tis all hap-hazard when one weds.
Gulbeyaz was an empress, but had been
Perhaps as wretched if a peasant's quean.
