<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">A hundred thousand men might fight again
With case; but where I sought for Ilion's walls,
The quiet sheep feeds, and the tortoise crawls;

Troops of untended horses; here and there
  Some little hamlets, with new names uncouth;
Some shepherds (unlike Paris) led to stare
  A moment at the European youth
Whom to the spot their school-boy feelings bear;
  A turk, with beads in hand and pipe in mouth,
Extremely taken with his own religion,
Are what I found thereâ€”but the devil a Phrygian.

Don Juan, here permitted to emerge
  From his dull cabin, found himself a slave;
Forlorn, and gazing on the deep blue surge,
  O'ershadow'd there by many a hero's grave;
Weak still with loss of blood, he scarce could urge
