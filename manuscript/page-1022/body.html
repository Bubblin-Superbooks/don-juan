<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">As music chimes in with a melodrame.
How sweet the task to shield an absent friend!
I ask but this of mine, to—not defend.

There were but two exceptions to this keen
  Skirmish of wits o'er the departed; one
Aurora, with her pure and placid mien;
  And Juan, too, in general behind none
In gay remark on what he had heard or seen,
  Sate silent now, his usual spirits gone:
In vain he heard the others rail or rally,
He would not join them in a single sally.

'T is true he saw Aurora look as though
  She approved his silence; she perhaps mistook
Its motive for that charity we owe
  But seldom pay the absent, nor would look
Farther—it might or might not be so.
