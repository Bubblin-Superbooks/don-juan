About the right divine how far we should
  Sell flesh and blood. When dinner has opprest one,
I think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour
Which turns up out of the sad twenty-four.

Voltaire says 'No:' he tells you that Candide
  Found life most tolerable after meals;
He 's wrongâ€”unless man were a pig, indeed,
  Repletion rather adds to what he feels,
Unless he 's drunk, and then no doubt he 's freed
  From his own brain's oppression while it reels.

Ammon's (ill pleased with one world and one father);

I think with Alexander, that the act
  Of eating, with another act or two,
Makes us feel our mortality in fact
