For theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound
  By the mere senses; and that which destroys
Most love, possession, unto them appear'd
A thing which each endearment more endear'd.

O beautiful! and rare as beautiful
  But theirs was love in which the mind delights
To lose itself when the old world grows dull,
  And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,
Intrigues, adventures of the common school,
  Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,
Where Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,
Whose husband only knows her not a wh—re.

Hard words; harsh truth; a truth which many know.
  Enough.—The faithful and the fairy pair,
Who never found a single hour too slow,
