A love of music and of scenes sublime,
  A pleasure in the gentle stream that flow'd
Past him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,
Bedew'd his spirit in his calmer hours.

But whatsoe'er he had of love reposed
  On that beloved daughter; she had been
The only thing which kept his heart unclosed
  Amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen;
A lonely pure affection unopposed:
  There wanted but the loss of this to wean
His feelings from all milk of human kindness,
And turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness.

The cubless tigress in her jungle raging
  Is dreadful to the shepherd and the flock;
The ocean when its yeasty war is waging
