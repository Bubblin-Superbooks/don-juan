And if their approbation we experience,
Perhaps they 'll have some more about a year hence.

My poem 's epic, and is meant to be
  Divided in twelve books; each book containing,
With love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,
  A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,
New characters; the episodes are three:
  A panoramic view of hell 's in training,
After the style of Virgil and of Homer,
So that my name of Epic 's no misnomer.

All these things will be specified in time,
  With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,
The Vade Mecum of the true sublime,
  Which makes so many poets, and some fools:
Prose poets like blank-verse, I 'm fond of rhyme,
