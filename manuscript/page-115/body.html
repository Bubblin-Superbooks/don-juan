<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Julia was sent into a convent: she
Grieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better
Shown in the following copy of her Letter:—

'They tell me 't is decided; you depart:
  'T is wise—'t is well, but not the less a pain;
I have no further claim on your young heart,
  Mine is the victim, and would be again;
To love too much has been the only art
  I used;—I write in haste, and if a stain
Be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;
My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.

'I loved, I love you, for this love have lost
  State, station, heaven, mankind's, my own esteem,
And yet can not regret what it hath cost,
  So dear is still the memory of that dream;
Yet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,
</pre></div> </div>
