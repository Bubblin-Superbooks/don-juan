An echo of a syllable that 's wrong:
  In fact, there 's nothing makes me so much grieve,
As that abominable tittle-tattle,
Which is the cud eschew'd by human cattle.

Moreover I 've remark'd (and I was once
  A slight observer in a modest way),
And so may every one except a dunce,
  That ladies in their youth a little gay,
Besides their knowledge of the world, and sense
  Of the sad consequence of going astray,
Are wiser in their warnings 'gainst the woe
Which the mere passionless can never know.

While the harsh prude indemnifies her virtue
  By railing at the unknown and envied passion,
Seeking far less to save you than to hurt you,
