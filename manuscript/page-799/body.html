To sit amidst the ruins of their guilt:
For Fame 's a Carthage not so soon rebuilt.

Perhaps this is as it should be;—it is
  A comment on the Gospel's 'Sin no more,
And be thy sins forgiven:'—but upon this
  I leave the saints to settle their own score.
Abroad, though doubtless they do much amiss,
  An erring woman finds an opener door
For her return to Virtue—as they cal
That lady, who should be at home to all.

For me, I leave the matter where I find it,
  Knowing that such uneasy virtue leads
People some ten times less in fact to mind it,
  And care but for discoveries and not deeds.
And as for chastity, you 'll never bind it
