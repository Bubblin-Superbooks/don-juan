<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">A bed is not a throne, and they may sleep,
Whate'er their dreams be, if of joys or woes:
  Yet disappointed joys are woes as deep
As any man's day mixture undergoes.
  Our least of sorrows are such as we weep;
'Tis the vile daily drop on drop which wears
The soul out (like the stone) with petty cares.

A scolding wife, a sullen son, a bill
  To pay, unpaid, protested, or discounted
At a per-centage; a child cross, dog ill,
  A favourite horse fallen lame just as he 's mounted,
A bad old woman making a worse will,
  Which leaves you minus of the cash you counted
As certain;â€”these are paltry things, and yet
I 've rarely seen the man they did not fret.

I 'm a philosopher; confound them all!
