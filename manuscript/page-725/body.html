<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The lamps of Westminster's more regular gleam,
The breadth of pavement, and yon shrine where fame is
  A spectral resident—whose pallid beam
In shape of moonshine hovers o'er the pile—
Make this a sacred part of Albion's isle.

The Druids' groves are gone—so much the better:
  Stone-Henge is not—but what the devil is it?-
But Bedlam still exists with its sage fetter,
  That madmen may not bite you on a visit;
The Bench too seats or suits full many a debtor;
  The Mansion House too (though some people quiz it)
To me appears a stiff yet grand erection;
But then the Abbey 's worth the whole collection.

The line of lights, too, up to Charing Cross,
  Pall Mall, and so forth, have a coruscation
Like gold as in comparison to dross,
