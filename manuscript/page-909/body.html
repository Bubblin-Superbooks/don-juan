<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">To thus much Adeline would not advance;
But of such friendship as man's may to man be
She was as capable as woman can be.

No doubt the secret influence of the sex
  Will there, as also in the ties of blood,
An innocent predominance annex,
  And tune the concord to a finer mood.
If free from passion, which all friendship checks,
  And your true feelings fully understood,
No friend like to a woman earth discovers,
So that you have not been nor will be lovers.

Love bears within its breast the very germ
  Of change; and how should this be otherwise?
That violent things more quickly find a term
  Is shown through nature's whole analogies;
And how should the most fierce of all be firm?
