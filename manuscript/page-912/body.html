<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">To the next Canto; where perhaps I shall
Say something to the purpose, and display
Considerable talent in my way.

Above all, I beg all men to forbear
  Anticipating aught about the matter:
They 'll only make mistakes about the fair,
  And Juan too, especially the latter.
And I shall take a much more serious air
  Than I have yet done, in this epic satire.
It is not clear that Adeline and Juan
Will fall; but if they do, 't will be their ruin.

But great things spring from little:â€”Would you think,
  That in our youth, as dangerous a passion
As e'er brought man and woman to the brink
  Of ruin, rose from such a slight occasion,
As few would ever dream could form the link
