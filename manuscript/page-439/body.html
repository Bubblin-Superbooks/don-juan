He left to his vizier all state affairs,
  And show'd but little royal curiosity:
I know not if he had domestic cares—
  No process proved connubial animosity;
Four wives and twice five hundred maids, unseen,
Were ruled as calmly as a Christian queen.

If now and then there happen'd a slight slip,
  Little was heard of criminal or crime;
The story scarcely pass'd a single lip—
  The sack and sea had settled all in time,
From which the secret nobody could rip:
  The Public knew no more than does this rhyme;
No scandals made the daily press a curse—
Morals were better, and the fish no worse.
