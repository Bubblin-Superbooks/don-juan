But I grow sadâ€”and let a tale grow cold,
Which must not be pathetically told.

The wind swept down the Euxine, and the wave
  Broke foaming o'er the blue Symplegades;
'T is a grand sight from off 'the Giant's Grave
  To watch the progress of those rolling seas
Between the Bosphorus, as they lash and lave
  Europe and Asia, you being quite at ease;
There 's not a sea the passenger e'er pukes in,
Turns up more dangerous breakers than the Euxine.

'T was a raw day of Autumn's bleak beginning,
  When nights are equal, but not so the days;
The Parcae then cut short the further spinning
  Of seamen's fates, and the loud tempests raise
The waters, and repentance for past sinning
