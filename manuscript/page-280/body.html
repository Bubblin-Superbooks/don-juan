His verses rarely wanted their due feet;
  And for his theme—he seldom sung below it,
He being paid to satirize or flatter,
As the psalm says, 'inditing a good matter.'

He praised the present, and abused the past,
  Reversing the good custom of old days,

For some few years his lot had been o'ercast
  By his seeming independent in his lays,

  And always changed as true as any needle;
His polar star being one which rather ranges,
