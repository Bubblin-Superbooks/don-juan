<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Beneath the very Reverend Rowley Powley,
Who shoes the glorious animal with stilts,
A modern Ancient Pistolâ€”by the hilts?

Then there 's my gentle Euphues, who, they say,
  Sets up for being a sort of moral me;
He 'll find it rather difficult some day
  To turn out both, or either, it may be.
Some persons think that Coleridge hath the sway;
  And Wordsworth has supporters, two or three;
And that deep-mouth'd Boeotian 'Savage Landor'
Has taken for a swan rogue Southey's gander.

John Keats, who was kill'd off by one critique,
  Just as he really promised something great,
If not intelligible, without Greek
  Contrived to talk about the gods of late,
Much as they might have been supposed to speak.
