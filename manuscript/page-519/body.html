When the sale of new books is not so fleet
  As they who print them think is necessary,
May likewise put off for a time what story
Sometimes calls 'murder,' and at others 'glory.'

Whether it was their engineer's stupidity,
  Their haste, or waste, I neither know nor care,
Or some contractor's personal cupidity,
  Saving his soul by cheating in the ware
Of homicide, but there was no solidity
  In the new batteries erected there;
They either miss'd, or they were never miss'd,
And added greatly to the missing list.

A sad miscalculation about distance
  Made all their naval matters incorrect;
Three fireships lost their amiable existence
