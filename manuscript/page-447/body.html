But Actium, lost for Cleopatra's eyes,
Outbalances all Caesar's victories.

He died at fifty for a queen of forty;
  I wish their years had been fifteen and twenty,
For then wealth, kingdoms, worlds are but a sport—I
  Remember when, though I had no great plenty
Of worlds to lose, yet still, to pay my court, I
  Gave what I had—a heart: as the world went, I
Gave what was worth a world; for worlds could never
Restore me those pure feelings, gone forever.

'Twas the boy's 'mite,' and, like the 'widow's,' may
  Perhaps be weigh'd hereafter, if not now;
But whether such things do or do not weigh,
  All who have loved, or love, will still allow
Life has nought like it. God is love, they say,
