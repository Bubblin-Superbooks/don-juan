The ear far more than thunder; for Heaven's flashes
Spare, or smite rarelyâ€”man's make millions ashes!

The column order'd on the assault scarce pass'd
  Beyond the Russian batteries a few toises,
When up the bristling Moslem rose at last,
  Answering the Christian thunders with like voices:
Then one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,
  Which rock'd as 't were beneath the mighty noises;
While the whole rampart blazed like Etna, when
The restless Titan hiccups in his den.

And one enormous shout of 'Allah!' rose
  In the same moment, loud as even the roar
Of war's most mortal engines, to their foes
  Hurling defiance: city, stream, and shore
Resounded 'Allah!' and the clouds which close
