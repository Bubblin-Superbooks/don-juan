(The last, if they have soul, are quite as good,
  Or better, as the best examples say:
Napoleon's, Mary's (queen of Scotland), should
  Lend to that colour a transcendent ray;
And Pallas also sanctions the same hue,
Too wise to look through optics black or blue)—

Her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,
  Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,
Her preference of a boy to men much bigger
  (Fellows whom Messalina's self would pension),
Her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,
  With other extras, which we need not mention,—
All these, or any one of these, explain
Enough to make a stripling very vain.

And that 's enough, for love is vanity,
