You may do right forbidding them to show 'em,
But spoil (I think) a very pretty poem.

O! ye, who make the fortunes of all books!
  Benign Ceruleans of the second sex!
Who advertise new poems by your looks,
  Your 'imprimatur' will ye not annex?
What! must I go to the oblivious cooks,
  Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?
Ah! must I then the only minstrel be,
Proscribed from tasting your Castalian tea!

What! can I prove 'a lion' then no more?
  A ball-room bard, a foolscap, hot-press darling?
To bear the compliments of many a bore,
  And sigh, 'I can't get out,' like Yorick's starling;
Why then I 'll swear, as poet Wordy swore
