<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">A supernatural agentâ€”or a mouse,
Whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass
Most people as it plays along the arras.

It was no mouse, but lo! a monk, array'd
  In cowl and beads and dusky garb, appear'd,
Now in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,
  With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;
His garments only a slight murmur made;
  He moved as shadowy as the sisters weird,
But slowly; and as he pass'd Juan by,
Glanced, without pausing, on him a bright eye.

Juan was petrified; he had heard a hint
  Of such a spirit in these halls of old,
But thought, like most men, there was nothing in 't
  Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,
Coin'd from surviving superstition's mint,
