'T is time to strike such puny doubters dumb as
The sceptics who would not believe Columbus.

Some people would impose now with authority,
  Turpin's or Monmouth Geoffry's Chronicle;
Men whose historical superiority
  Is always greatest at a miracle.
But Saint Augustine has the great priority,
  Who bids all men believe the impossible,
Because 't is so. Who nibble, scribble, quibble, he
Quiets at once with 'quia impossibile.'

And if it is impossible, you shall:
  'T is always best to take things upon trust.
