Without cash, camps were thin, and courts were none;
  Without cash, Malthus tells youâ€”'take no brides.'
So Cash rules Love the ruler, on his own
  High ground, as virgin Cynthia sways the tides:
And as for Heaven 'Heaven being Love,' why not say honey
Is wax? Heaven is not Love, 't is Matrimony.

Is not all love prohibited whatever,
  Excepting marriage? which is love, no doubt,
After a sort; but somehow people never
  With the same thought the two words have help'd out:
Love may exist with marriage, and should ever,
  And marriage also may exist without;
But love sans bans is both a sin and shame,
And ought to go by quite another</pre></div> </div>
