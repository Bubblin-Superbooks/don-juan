<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">I reck not if an acorn gave it birth.
To trace all actions to their secret springs
  Would make indeed some melancholy mirth;
But this is not at present my concern,
And I refer you to wise Oxenstiern.

With the kind view of saving an eclat,
  Both to the duchess and diplomatist,
The Lady Adeline, as soon 's she saw
  That Juan was unlikely to resist
(For foreigners don't know that a faux pas
  In England ranks quite on a different list
From those of other lands unblest with juries,
Whose verdict for such sin a certain cure is);â€”

The Lady Adeline resolved to take
  Such measures as she thought might best impede
The farther progress of this sad mistake.
