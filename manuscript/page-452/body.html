May look like what is—neither here nor there,
  They are put on as easily as a hat,
Or rather bonnet, which the fair sex wear,
  Trimm'd either heads or hearts to decorate,
Which form an ornament, but no more part
Of heads, than their caresses of the heart.

A slight blush, a soft tremor, a calm kind
  Of gentle feminine delight, and shown
More in the eyelids than the eyes, resign'd
  Rather to hide what pleases most unknown,
Are the best tokens (to a modest mind)
  Of love, when seated on his loveliest throne,
A sincere woman's breast,—for over-warm
Or over-cold annihilates the charm.

For over-warmth, if false, is worse than truth;
