By carrying off Count Cesare Cicogna
From an old Roman princess at Bologna.

'And then there are the dancers; there 's the Nini,
  With more than one profession, gains by all;
Then there 's that laughing slut the Pelegrini,
  She, too, was fortunate last carnival,
And made at least five hundred good zecchini,
  But spends so fast, she has not now a paul;
And then there 's the Grotescaâ€”such a dancer!
Where men have souls or bodies she must answer.

  The rest of all that tribe; with here and there
A pretty person, which perhaps may strike,
  The rest are hardly fitted for a fair;
There 's one, though tall and stiffer than a pike,
