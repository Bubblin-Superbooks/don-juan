<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Till a gigantic portal through the gloom,
Haughty and huge, along the distance lowers;
  And wafted far arose a rich perfume:
It seem'd as though they came upon a shrine,
For all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine.

The giant door was broad, and bright, and high,
  Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;
Warriors thereon were battling furiously;
  Here stalks the victor, there the vanquish'd lies;
There captives led in triumph droop the eye,
  And in perspective many a squadron flies:
It seems the work of times before the line
Of Rome transplanted fell with Constantine.

This massy portal stood at the wide close
  Of a huge hall, and on its either side
Two little dwarfs, the least you could suppose,
