<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Be for mere fancy's sport a theme creative,
A jest, a riddle, Fame through thin and thick sought!
And Socrates himself but Wisdom's Quixote?

Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away;
  A single laugh demolish'd the right arm
Of his own country;—seldom since that day
  Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,
The world gave ground before her bright array;
  And therefore have his volumes done such harm,
That all their glory, as a composition,
Was dearly purchased by his land's perdition.

I 'm 'at my old lunes'—digression, and forget
  The Lady Adeline Amundeville;
The fair most fatal Juan ever met,
  Although she was not evil nor meant ill;
But Destiny and Passion spread the net
