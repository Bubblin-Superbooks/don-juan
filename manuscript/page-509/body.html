<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">By saint, by sage, by preacher, and by poet,
Must I restrain me, through the fear of strife,
From holding up the nothingness of life?

Dogs, or men!—for I flatter you in saying
  That ye are dogs—your betters far—ye may
Read, or read not, what I am now essaying
  To show ye what ye are in every way.
As little as the moon stops for the baying
  Of wolves, will the bright muse withdraw one ray
From out her skies—then howl your idle wrath!
While she still silvers o'er your gloomy path.

'Fierce loves and faithless wars'—I am not sure
  If this be the right reading—'t is no matter;
The fact 's about the same, I am secure;
  I sing them both, and am about to batter
A town which did a famous siege endure,
