     When an heir is born, he 's heard to mourn,
       And when aught is to befall
     That ancient line, in the "we moonshine
       He walks from hall to hall.
     His form you may trace, but not his face,
       'T is shadow'd by his cowl;
     But his eyes may be seen from the folds between,
       And they seem of a parted soul.

     But beware! beware! of the Black Friar,
       He still retains his sway,
     For he is yet the church's heir
       Whoever may be the lay.
     Amundeville is lord by day,
       But the monk is lord by night;
     Nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal
