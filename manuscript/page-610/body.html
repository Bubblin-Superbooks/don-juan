As he look'd down upon his children gone,
And felt—though done with life—he was alone

But 't was a transient tremor;—with a spring
  Upon the Russian steel his breast he flung,
As carelessly as hurls the moth her wing
  Against the light wherein she dies: he clung
Closer, that all the deadlier they might wring,
  Unto the bayonets which had pierced his young;
And throwing back a dim look on his sons,
In one wide wound pour'd forth his soul at once.

'T is strange enough—the rough, tough soldiers, who
  Spared neither sex nor age in their career
Of carnage, when this old man was pierced through,
  And lay before them with his children near,
Touch'd by the heroism of him they slew,
