<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Leaves nothing till 'the coming of the just'-
Save change: I 've stood upon Achilles' tomb,
And heard Troy doubted; time will doubt of Rome.

The very generations of the dead
  Are swept away, and tomb inherits tomb,
Until the memory of an age is fled,
  And, buried, sinks beneath its offspring's doom:
Where are the epitaphs our fathers read?
  Save a few glean'd from the sepulchral gloom
Which once-named myriads nameless lie beneath,
And lose their own in universal death.

I canter by the spot each afternoon
  Where perish'd in his fame the hero-boy,
Who lived too long for men, but died too soon
  For human vanity, the young De Foix!
A broken pillar, not uncouthly hewn,
</pre></div> </div>
