And I know nothing which could make amends
  For a return to hatred: I would shun her
Like garlic, howsoever she extends
  Her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.
Old flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes—
Converted foes should scorn to join with those.

This were the worst desertion:—renegadoes,
  Even shuffling Southey, that incarnate lie,
Would scarcely join again the 'reformadoes,'
  Whom he forsook to fill the laureate's sty:
And honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,
  Whether in Caledon or Italy,
Should not veer round with every breath, nor seize
To pain, the moment when you cease to please.
