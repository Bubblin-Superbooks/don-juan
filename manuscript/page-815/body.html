And the Lord Henry was a great debater,
So that few members kept the house up later.

These were advantages: and then he thought—
  It was his foible, but by no means sinister—
That few or none more than himself had caught
  Court mysteries, having been himself a minister:
He liked to teach that which he had been taught,
  And greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;
And reconciled all qualities which grace man,
Always a patriot, and sometimes a placeman.

Because, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,
  Or contradicted but with proud humility.
He knew the world, and would not see depravity
