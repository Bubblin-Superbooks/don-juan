Had not Cervantes, in that too true tale
Of Quixote, shown how all such efforts fail.

Of all tales 't is the saddest—and more sad,
  Because it makes us smile: his hero 's right,
And still pursues the right;—to curb the bad
  His only object, and 'gainst odds to fight
His guerdon: 't is his virtue makes him mad!
  But his adventures form a sorry sight;
A sorrier still is the great moral taught
By that real epic unto all who have thought.

Redressing injury, revenging wrong,
  To aid the damsel and destroy the caitiff;
Opposing singly the united strong,
  From foreign yoke to free the helpless native:—
Alas! must noblest views, like an old song,
