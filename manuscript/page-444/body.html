<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And Wedlock and a Padlock mean the same;
Excepting only when the former 's pick'd
  It ne'er can be replaced in proper frame;
Spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when prick'd:
  But then their own Polygamy 's to blame;
Why don't they knead two virtuous souls for life
Into that moral centaur, man and wife?

Thus far our chronicle; and now we pause,
  Though not for want of matter; but 't is time
According to the ancient epic laws,
  To slacken sail, and anchor with our rhyme.
Let this fifth canto meet with due applause,
  The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime;
Meanwhile, as Homer sometimes sleeps, perhaps
You 'll pardon to my muse a few short naps.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
