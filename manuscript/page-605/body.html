As being a virtue, like terrestrial patience,
Apt to wear out on trifling provocations.

And spite of Johnson and of Juan, who
  Expended all their Eastern phraseology
In begging him, for God's sake, just to show
  So much less fight as might form an apology
For them in saving such a desperate foeâ€”

When they dispute with sceptics; and with curses
Struck at his friends, as babies beat their nurses.

The first with sighs, the second with an oath,
  Upon his angry sultanship, pell-mell,
And all around were grown exceeding wroth
