<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Nations athwart the deep: the golden rays
Flash up in ingots from the mine obscure;
  On him the diamond pours its brilliant blaze,
While the mild emerald's beam shades down the dies
Of other stones, to soothe the miser's eyes.

The lands on either side are his; the ship
  From Ceylon, Inde, or far Cathay, unloads
For him the fragrant produce of each trip;
  Beneath his cars of Ceres groan the roads,
And the vine blushes like Aurora's lip;
  His very cellars might be kings' abodes;
While he, despising every sensual call,
Commands—the intellectual lord of all.

Perhaps he hath great projects in his mind,
  To build a college, or to found a race,
A hospital, a church,—and leave behind
