<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">On life's worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated,
To set up vain pretence of being great,
  'T is not so to be good; and be it stated,
The worthiest kings have ever loved least state;
  And tell themâ€”But you won't, and I have prated
Just now enough; but by and by I 'll prattle
Like Roland's horn in Roncesvalles' battle.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
