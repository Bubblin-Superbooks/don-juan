And frights, especially if 'tis a daughter,
The old hen by running headlong to the water.

There is a commonplace book argument,
  Which glibly glides from every vulgar tongue

  Upon all points, no matter what or whose,
Because as ages upon ages push on,
  The last is apt the former to accuse
Of pillowing its head on a pincushion,
