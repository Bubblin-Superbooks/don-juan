<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,
  By distance mellow'd, o'er the waters sweep;
'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;
  'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep
From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high
The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.

'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark
  Bay deep-mouth'd welcome as we draw near home;
'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark
  Our coming, and look brighter when we come;
'T is sweet to be awaken'd by the lark,
  Or lull'd by falling waters; sweet the hum
Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,
The lisp of children, and their earliest words.

Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes
