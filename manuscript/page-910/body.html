Methinks Love's very title says enough:
How should 'the tender passion' e'er be tough?

Alas! by all experience, seldom yet
  (I merely quote what I have heard from many)
Had lovers not some reason to regret
  The passion which made Solomon a zany.
I 've also seen some wives (not to forget
  The marriage state, the best or worst of any)
Who were the very paragons of wives,
Yet made the misery of at least two lives.

I 've also seen some female friends ( 't is odd,
  But true—as, if expedient, I could prove)
That faithful were through thick and thin, abroad,
  At home, far more than ever yet was Love—
Who did not quit me when Oppression trod
