Whate'er the cause are orphans in effect.

But to return unto the stricter rule
  (As far as words make rules), our common notion
Of orphans paints at once a parish school,
   A half-starved babe, a wreck upon life's ocean,
A human (what the Italians nickname) 'mule',
   A theme for pity or some worse emotion;
Yet, if examined, it might be admitted
The wealthiest orphans are to be more pitied.

Too soon they are parents to themselves; for what
   Are tutors, guardians, and so forth, compared
With Nature's genial genitors, so that
  A child of Chancery, that Star Chamber ward
(I'll take the likeness I can first come at),
   Is like a duckling by Dame Partlett</pre></div> </div>
