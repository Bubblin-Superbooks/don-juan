<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Dear Jefferson, once my most redoubted foe
(As far as rhyme and criticism combine
  To make such puppets of us things below),
Are over: Here 's a health to 'Auld Lang Syne!'
  I do not know you, and may never know
Your face—but you have acted on the whole
Most nobly, and I own it from my soul.

And when I use the phrase of 'Auld Lang Syne!'
  'T is not address'd to you—the more 's the pity
For me, for I would rather take my wine
  With you, than aught (save Scott) in your proud city.
But somehow,—it may seem a schoolboy's whine,
  And yet I seek not to be grand nor witty,
But I am half a Scot by birth, and bred
A whole one, and my heart flies to my head,—

As 'Auld Lang Syne' brings Scotland, one and all,
