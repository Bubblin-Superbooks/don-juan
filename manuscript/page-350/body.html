<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Lady to lady, well as man to man,
Were to be chain'd and lotted out per couple,
For the slave market of Constantinople.

It seems when this allotment was made out,
  There chanced to be an odd male, and odd female,
Who (after some discussion and some doubt,
  If the soprano might be deem'd to be male,
They placed him o'er the women as a scout)
  Were link'd together, and it happen'd the male
Was Juan,â€”who, an awkward thing at his age,
Pair'd off with a Bacchante blooming visage.

With Raucocanti lucklessly was chain'd
  The tenor; these two hated with a hate
Found only on the stage, and each more pain'd
  With this his tuneful neighbour than his fate;
Sad strife arose, for they were so cross-grain'd,
