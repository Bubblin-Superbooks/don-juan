      To sounds which echo further west
      Than your sires' 'Islands of the Blest.'

      The mountains look on Marathon—
        And Marathon looks on the sea;
      And musing there an hour alone,
        I dream'd that Greece might still be free;
      For standing on the Persians' grave,
      I could not deem myself a slave.

      A king sate on the rocky brow
        Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;
      And ships, by thousands, lay below,
        And men in nations;—all were his!
      He counted them at break of day—
      And when the sun set where were they?
