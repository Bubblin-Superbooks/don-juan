<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The baser sides of literature and life,
And nought remains unseen, but much untold,
  By those who scour those double vales of strife.
While common men grow ignorantly old,
  The lawyer's brief is like the surgeon's knife,
Dissecting the whole inside of a question,
And with it all the process of digestion.

A legal broom 's a moral chimney-sweeper,
  And that 's the reason he himself 's so dirty;
The endless soot bestows a tint far deeper
  Than can be hid by altering his shirt; he
Retains the sable stains of the dark creeper,
  At least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,
In all their habits;â€”not so you, I own;
As Caesar wore his robe you wear your gown.

And all our little feuds, at least all mine,
