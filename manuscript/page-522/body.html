And so he says no moreâ€”but pays his court
  To some distinguish'd strangers in that fray;
The Prince de Ligne, and Langeron, and Damas,
Names great as any that the roll of Fame has.

This being the case, may show us what Fame is:
  For out of these three 'preux Chevaliers,' how
Many of common readers give a guess
  That such existed? (and they may live now
For aught we know.) Renown 's all hit or miss;
  There 's fortune even in fame, we must allow.
'T is true the Memoirs of the Prince de Ligne
Have half withdrawn from him oblivion's screen.

But here are men who fought in gallant actions
  As gallantly as ever heroes fought,
But buried in the heap of such transactions
