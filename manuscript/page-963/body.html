<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And positively henceforth no temptation
Shall 'fool me to the top up of my bent:'-
  Yes, I' ll begin a thorough reformation.
Indeed, I never knew what people meant
  By deeming that my Muse's conversation
Was dangerous;—I think she is as harmless
As some who labour more and yet may charm less.

Grim reader! did you ever see a ghost?
  No; but you have heard—I understand—be dumb!
And don't regret the time you may have lost,
  For you have got that pleasure still to come:
And do not think I mean to sneer at most
  Of these things, or by ridicule benumb
That source of the sublime and the mysterious:—
For certain reasons my belief is serious.

Serious? You laugh;—you may: that will I not;
