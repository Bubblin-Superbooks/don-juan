<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Fair Catherine's pastime—who look'd on the match
Between these nations as a main of cocks,
Wherein she liked her own to stand like rocks.

And there in a kibitka he roll'd on
  (A cursed sort of carriage without springs,
Which on rough roads leaves scarcely a whole bone),
  Pondering on glory, chivalry, and kings,
And orders, and on all that he had done—
  And wishing that post-horses had the wings
Of Pegasus, or at the least post-chaises
Had feathers, when a traveller on deep ways is.

At every jolt—and they were many—still
  He turn'd his eyes upon his little charge,
As if he wish'd that she should fare less ill
  Than he, in these sad highways left at large
To ruts, and flints, and lovely Nature's skill,
