<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">They haggled, wrangled, swore, tooâ€”so they did!
As though they were in a mere Christian fair
  Cheapening an ox, an ass, a lamb, or kid;
So that their bargain sounded like a battle
For this superior yoke of human cattle.

At last they settled into simple grumbling,
  And pulling out reluctant purses, and
Turning each piece of silver o'er, and tumbling
  Some down, and weighing others in their hand,
And by mistake sequins with paras jumbling,
  Until the sum was accurately scann'd,
And then the merchant giving change, and signing
Receipts in full, began to think of dining.

I wonder if his appetite was good?
  Or, if it were, if also his digestion?
Methinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude,
