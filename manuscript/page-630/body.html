But would much rather have a sound digestion
  Than Buonaparte's cancer: could I dash on
Through fifty victories to shame or fame—

Let this one toil for bread—that rack for rent,
He who sleeps best may be the most content.

'To be, or not to be?'—Ere I decide,
  I should be glad to know that which is being?
