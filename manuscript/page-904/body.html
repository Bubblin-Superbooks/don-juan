Shut up the bald-coot bully Alexander!
  Ship off the Holy Three to Senegal;
Teach them that 'sauce for goose is sauce for gander,'
  And ask them how they like to be in thrall?
Shut up each high heroic salamander,
  Who eats fire gratis (since the pay 's but small);
Shut upâ€”no, not the King, but the Pavilion,
Or else 't will cost us all another million.

Shut up the world at large, let Bedlam out;
  And you will be perhaps surprised to find
All things pursue exactly the same route,
  As now with those of soi-disant sound mind.
This I could prove beyond a single doubt,
  Were there a jot of sense among mankind;
But till that point d'appui is found,</pre></div> </div>
