Had bow'd themselves before th' imperial eyes,
  And at the usual signal ta'en their way
Back to their chambers, those long galleries
  In the seraglio, where the ladies lay
Their delicate limbs; a thousand bosoms there
Beating for love, as the caged bird's for air.

I love the sex, and sometimes would reverse
  The tyrant's wish, 'that mankind only had
One neck, which he with one fell stroke might pierce:'
  My wish is quite as wide, but not so bad,
And much more tender on the whole than fierce;
  It being (not now, but only while a lad)
That womankind had but one rosy mouth,
To kiss them all at once from North to South.

O, enviable Briareus! with thy hands
