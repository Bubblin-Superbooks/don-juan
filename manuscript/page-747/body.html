'Midst royal dukes and dames condemn'd to climb,
And gain an inch of staircase at a time.

Thrice happy he who, after a survey
  Of the good company, can win a corner,
A door that's in or boudoir out of the way,
  Where he may fix himself like small 'Jack Horner,'
And let the Babel round run as it may,
  And look on as a mourner, or a scorner,
Or an approver, or a mere spectator,
Yawning a little as the night grows later.

But this won't do, save by and by; and he
  Who, like Don Juan, takes an active share,
Must steer with care through all that glittering sea
  Of gems and plumes and pearls and silks, to where
He deems it is his proper place to be;
