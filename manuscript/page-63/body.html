<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And here thou art a god indeed divine.'
The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,
  With the exception of the second line,
For that same twining 'transport and security'
Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.

The poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals
  To the good sense and senses of mankind,
The very thing which every body feels,
  As all have found on trial, or may find,
That no one likes to be disturb'd at meals
  Or love.â€”I won't say more about 'entwined'
Or 'transport,' as we knew all that before,
But beg 'Security' will bolt the door.

Young Juan wander'd by the glassy brooks,
  Thinking unutterable things; he threw
Himself at length within the leafy nooks
