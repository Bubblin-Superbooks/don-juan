<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">They nearly reach'd her heel; and in her air
There was a something which bespoke command,
As one who was a lady in the land.

Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes
  Were black as death, their lashes the same hue,
Of downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies
  Deepest attraction; for when to the view
Forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,
  Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;
'T is as the snake late coil'd, who pours his length,
And hurls at once his venom and his strength.

Her brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye
  Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;
Short upper lipâ€”sweet lips! that make us sigh
  Ever to have seen such; for she was one
Fit for the model of a statuary
