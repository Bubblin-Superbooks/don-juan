She did not run away, too,—did she, sir?'
'No, faith.'—'What then?'—'I ran away from her.'

'You take things coolly, sir,' said Juan. 'Why,'
  Replied the other, 'what can a man do?
There still are many rainbows in your sky,
  But mine have vanish'd. All, when life is new,
Commence with feelings warm, and prospects high;
  But time strips our illusions of their hue,
And one by one in turn, some grand mistake
Casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake.

  Or fresher, brighter; but the year gone through,
This skin must go the way, too, of all flesh,
  Or sometimes only wear a week or two;—
Love 's the first net which spreads its deadly mesh;
