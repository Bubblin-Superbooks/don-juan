<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,
With just enough of life to feel its pain,
And deem that it was saved, perhaps in vain.

With slow and staggering effort he arose,
  But sunk again upon his bleeding knee
And quivering hand; and then he look'd for those
  Who long had been his mates upon the sea;
But none of them appear'd to share his woes,
  Save one, a corpse, from out the famish'd three,
Who died two days before, and now had found
An unknown barren beach for burial ground.

And as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,
  And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand
Swam round and round, and all his senses pass'd:
  He fell upon his side, and his stretch'd hand
Droop'd dripping on the oar (their jurymast),
