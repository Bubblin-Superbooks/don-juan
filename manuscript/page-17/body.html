<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">States to be curbed and thoughts to be confined,
Conspiracy or congress to be made,
  Cobbling at manacles for all mankind,
A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,
With God and man's abhorrence for its gains.

If we may judge of matter by the mind,
Emasculated to the marrow, it
Hath but two objects, how to serve and bind,
Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit,
Eutropius of its many masters, blind
To worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,
Fearless, because no feeling dwells in ice;
Its very courage stagnates to a vice.

Where shall I turn me not to view its bonds,
  For I will never feel them. Italy,
Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds
