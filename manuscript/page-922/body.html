<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">To shield himself than put you on your guard:
Perhaps 't was hardly quite assured enough,
  But modesty 's at times its own reward,
Like virtue; and the absence of pretension
Will go much farther than there 's need to mention.

Serene, accomplish'd, cheerful but not loud;
  Insinuating without insinuation;
Observant of the foibles of the crowd,
  Yet ne'er betraying this in conversation;
Proud with the proud, yet courteously proud,
  So as to make them feel he knew his station
And theirs:â€”without a struggle for priority,
He neither brook'd nor claim'd superiority.

That is, with men: with women he was what
  They pleased to make or take him for; and their
Imagination 's quite enough for that:
