<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">While I, without remorse of rhyme, or fear,
Have built and laid out ground at such a rate,
  Dan Phoebus takes me for an auctioneer.
That poets were so from their earliest date,
  By Homer's 'Catalogue of ships' is clear;
But a mere modern must be moderate—
I spare you then the furniture and plate.

The mellow autumn came, and with it came
  The promised party, to enjoy its sweets.
The corn is cut, the manor full of game;
  The pointer ranges, and the sportsman beats
In russet jacket:—lynx-like is his aim;
  Full grows his bag, and wonderful his feats.
Ah, nut-brown partridges! Ah, brilliant pheasants!
And ah, ye poachers!—'T is no sport for peasants.

An English autumn, though it hath no vines,
