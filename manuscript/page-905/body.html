Like Archimedes, I leave earth as 't was.

Our gentle Adeline had one defectâ€”
  Her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;
Her conduct had been perfectly correct,
  As she had seen nought claiming its expansion.
A wavering spirit may be easier wreck'd,
  Because 't is frailer, doubtless, than a stanch one;
But when the latter works its own undoing,
Its inner crash is like an earthquake's ruin.

She loved her lord, or thought so; but that love
  Cost her an effort, which is a sad toil,
The stone of Sisyphus, if once we move
  Our feelings 'gainst the nature of the soil.
She had nothing to complain of, or reprove,
  No bickerings, no connubial</pre></div> </div>
