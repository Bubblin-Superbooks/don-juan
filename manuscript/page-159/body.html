It seem'd as if they had exchanged their care,
  For Juan wore the magisterial face
Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair
  Of eyes were crying for their owner's case:

  But the same cause, conducive to his loss,
Left him so drunk, he jump'd into the wave

Because the sea ran higher every minute,
And for the boat—the crew kept crowding in it.
