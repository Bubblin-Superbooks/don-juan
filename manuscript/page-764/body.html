Perhaps he fain would liberate mankind
  Even with the very ore which makes them base;
Perhaps he would be wealthiest of his nation,
Or revel in the joys of calculation.

But whether all, or each, or none of these
  May be the hoarder's principle of action,

Wars, revels, loves—do these bring men more ease
  Than the mere plodding through each 'vulgar fraction'?

  Containing ingots, bags of dollars,</pre></div> </div>
