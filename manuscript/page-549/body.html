<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Say, that he scuds before it like a brig,
A schooner, or—but it is time to ease
  This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.
The next shall ring a peal to shake all people,
Like a bob-major from a village steeple.

Hark! through the silence of the cold, dull night,
  The hum of armies gathering rank on rank!
Lo! dusky masses steal in dubious sight
  Along the leaguer'd wall and bristling bank
Of the arm'd river, while with straggling light
  The stars peep through the vapours dim and dank,
Which curl in curious wreaths:—how soon the smoke
Of Hell shall pall them in a deeper cloak!

Here pause we for the present—as even then
  That awful pause, dividing life from death,
Struck for an instant on the hearts of men,
