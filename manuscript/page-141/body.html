Beloved Julia, hear me still beseeching!'
(Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)

He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,
  Or rather stomach, which, alas! attends,
Beyond the best apothecary's art,
  The loss of love, the treachery of friends,
Or death of those we dote on, when a part
  Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:
No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,
But the sea acted as a strong emetic. I

Love 's a capricious power: I 've known it hold
  Out through a fever caused by its own heat,
But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,
  And find a quincy very hard to treat;
Against all noble maladies he 's bold,
