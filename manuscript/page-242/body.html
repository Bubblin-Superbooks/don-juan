Are laid within our bosoms but to perish.

In her first passion woman loves her lover,
  In all the others all she loves is love,
Which grows a habit she can ne'er get over,
  And fits her looselyâ€”like an easy glove,
As you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:
  One man alone at first her heart can move;
She then prefers him in the plural number,
Not finding that the additions much encumber.

I know not if the fault be men's or theirs;
  But one thing 's pretty sure; a woman planted
(Unless at once she plunge for life in prayers)
  After a decent time must be gallanted;
Although, no doubt, her first of love affairs
  Is that to which her heart is wholly</pre></div> </div>
