<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">For my part, to such doings I 'm a stranger,
But hear these freedoms form the utmost list
  Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:
If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,
But not my fault—I tell them all in time.

Love, then, but love within its proper limits,
  Was Julia's innocent determination
In young Don Juan's favour, and to him its
  Exertion might be useful on occasion;
And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its
  Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion
He might be taught, by love and her together—
I really don't know what, nor Julia either.

Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced
  In mail of proof—her purity of soul—
She, for the future of her strength convinced.
