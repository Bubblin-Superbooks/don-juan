<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Love with you, and been in the dog-days stung
By your refusal, recollect her raging!
  Or recollect all that was said or sung
On such a subject; then suppose the face
Of a young downright beauty in this case.

Suppose,—but you already have supposed,
  The spouse of Potiphar, the Lady Booby,
Phaedra, and all which story has disclosed
  Of good examples; pity that so few by
Poets and private tutors are exposed,
  To educate—ye youth of Europe—you by!
But when you have supposed the few we know,
You can't suppose Gulbeyaz' angry brow.

A tigress robb'd of young, a lioness,
  Or any interesting beast of prey,
Are similes at hand for the distress
