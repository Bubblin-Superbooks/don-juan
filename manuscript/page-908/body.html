<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">If such can e'er be drawn by man's capacity:
My business is with Lady Adeline,
Who in her way too was a heroine.

She knew not her own heart; then how should I?
  I think not she was then in love with Juan:
If so, she would have had the strength to fly
  The wild sensation, unto her a new one:
She merely felt a common sympathy
  (I will not say it was a false or true one)
In him, because she thought he was in danger,—
Her husband's friend, her own, young, and a stranger,

She was, or thought she was, his friend—and this
  Without the farce of friendship, or romance
Of Platonism, which leads so oft amiss
  Ladies who have studied friendship but in France,
Or Germany, where people purely kiss.
