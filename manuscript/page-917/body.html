The ruby glass that shakes within his hand
Leaves a sad sediment of Time's worst sand.

And as for love—O love!—We will proceed.
  The Lady Adeline Amundeville,
A pretty name as one would wish to read,
  Must perch harmonious on my tuneful quill.
There 's music in the sighing of a reed;
  There 's music in the gushing of a rill;
There 's music in all things, if men had ears:
Their earth is but an echo of the spheres.

The Lady Adeline, right honourable;
  And honour'd, ran a risk of growing less so;
For few of the soft sex are very stable
  In their resolves—alas! that I should say so!
They differ as wine differs from its label,
