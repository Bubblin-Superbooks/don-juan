He cast a rueful look or two, and did,
He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.

With him retired his 'posse comitatus,'
  The attorney last, who linger'd near the door
Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as
  Antonia let him—not a little sore
At this most strange and unexplain'd 'hiatus'
  In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore
An awkward look; as he revolved the case,
The door was fasten'd in his legal face.

No sooner was it bolted, than—Oh shame!
  O sin! Oh sorrow! and oh womankind!
How can you do such things and keep your fame,
  Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?
Nothing so dear as an unfilch'd good name!
