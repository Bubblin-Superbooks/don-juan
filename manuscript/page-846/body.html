I 've seen a virtuous woman put down quite
  By the mere combination of a coterie;
Also a so-so matron boldly fight
  Her way back to the world by dint of plottery,
And shine the very Siria of the spheres,
Escaping with a few slight, scarless sneers.

I have seen more than I 'll say:—but we will see
  How our villeggiatura will get on.

  Of highest caste—the Brahmins of the ton.
I have named a few, not foremost in degree,
  But ta'en at hazard as the rhyme may run.
By way of sprinkling, scatter'd amongst these,
There also were some Irish absentees.

There was Parolles, too, the legal bully,
