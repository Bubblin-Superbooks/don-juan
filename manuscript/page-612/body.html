His beard, he puff'd his pipe's ambrosial gales,
As if he had three lives, as well as tails.

The town was takenâ€”whether he might yield
  Himself or bastion, little matter'd now:
His stubborn valour was no future shield.
  Ismail 's no more! The crescent's silver bow
Sunk, and the crimson cross glared o'er the field,
  But red with no redeeming gore: the glow
Of burning streets, like moonlight on the water,
Was imaged back in blood, the sea of slaughter.

All that the mind would shrink from of excesses;
  All that the body perpetrates of bad;
All that we read, hear, dream, of man's distresses;
  All that the devil would do if run stark mad;
All that defies the worst which pen expresses;
