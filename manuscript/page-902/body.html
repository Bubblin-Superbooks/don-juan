<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">A rack of pleasures, where we must invent
A something wherewithal to be annoy'd.
  Bards may sing what they please about Content;
Contented, when translated, means but cloy'd;
  And hence arise the woes of sentiment,
Blue devils, and blue-stockings, and romances
Reduced to practice, and perform'd like dances.

I do declare, upon an affidavit,
  Romances I ne'er read like those I have seen;
Nor, if unto the world I ever gave it,
  Would some believe that such a tale had been:
But such intent I never had, nor have it;
  Some truths are better kept behind a screen,
Especially when they would look like lies;
I therefore deal in generalities.

'An oyster may be cross'd in love,'â€”and why?
