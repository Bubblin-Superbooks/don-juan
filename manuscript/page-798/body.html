But though the soil may give you time and trouble,
Well cultivated, it will render double.

And if in fact she takes to a 'grande passion,'
  It is a very serious thing indeed:
Nine times in ten 't is but caprice or fashion,
  Coquetry, or a wish to take the lead,
The pride of a mere child with a new sash on,
  Or wish to make a rival's bosom bleed:
But the tenth instance will be a tornado,
For there 's no saying what they will or may do.

The reason 's obvious; if there 's an eclat,
  They lose their caste at once, as do the Parias;
And when the delicacies of the law
  Have fill'd their papers with their comments various,
Society, that china without flaw
