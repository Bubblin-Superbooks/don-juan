Perhaps she wish'd an aspirant profounder;
  But whatsoe'er she wish'd, she acted right;
And whether coldness, pride, or virtue dignify
A woman, so she 's good, what does it signify?

  Which with the landlord makes too long a stand,
Leaving all-claretless the unmoisten'd throttle,
  Especially with politics on hand;
I hate it, as I hate a drove of cattle,
  Who whirl the dust as simooms whirl the sand;
I hate it, as I hate an argument,
A laureate's ode, or servile peer's 'content.'

  They are so much intertwisted with the earth;
So that the branch a goodly verdure flings,
