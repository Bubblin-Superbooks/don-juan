But still the spouseless virgin Knowledge flies.
  What are we? and whence came we? what shall be
Our ultimate existence? what 's our present?

There was deep silence in the chamber: dim
  And distant from each other burn'd the lights,
And slumber hover'd o'er each lovely limb
  Of the fair occupants: if there be sprites,
They should have walk'd there in their sprightliest trim,
  By way of change from their sepulchral sites,
And shown themselves as ghosts of better taste
Than haunting some old ruin or wild waste.

Many and beautiful lay those around,
  Like flowers of different hue, and dime, and root,
In some exotic garden sometimes found,
