<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">A quantity of palisades upright,
So placed as to impede the fire of those
Who held the place, and to assist the foe's.

This circumstance may serve to give a notion
  Of the high talents of this new Vauban:
But the town ditch below was deep as ocean,
  The rampart higher than you 'd wish to hang:
But then there was a great want of precaution
  (Prithee, excuse this engineering slang),
Nor work advanced, nor cover'd way was there,
To hint at least 'Here is no thoroughfare.'

But a stone bastion, with a narrow gorge,
  And walls as thick as most skulls born as yet;
Two batteries, cap-a-pie, as our St. George,
  Case-mated one, and t' other 'a barbette,'
Of Danube's bank took formidable charge;
