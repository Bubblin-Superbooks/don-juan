Her blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth:
  Judge, then, if her caprices e'er stood still;
Had she but been a Christian, I 've a notion
We should have found out the 'perpetual motion.'

Whate'er she saw and coveted was brought;
  Whate'er she did not see, if she supposed
It might be seen, with diligence was sought,
  And when 't was found straightway the bargain closed;
There was no end unto the things she bought,
  Nor to the trouble which her fancies caused;
Yet even her tyranny had such a grace,
The women pardon'd all except her face.

Juan, the latest of her whims, had caught
  Her eye in passing on his way to sale;
She order'd him directly to be bought,
