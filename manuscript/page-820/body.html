And thus with women: howsoe'er it shocks some's

  For such a shield, which leaves but little merit
To virtue proper, or good education.

Which judged mankind at their due estimation;
  And for coquetry, she disdain'd to wear it:
Secure of admiration, its impression
Was faint, as of an every-day possession.

Which flatters, but is flattery convey'd
  In such a sort as cannot leave behind
A trace unworthy either wife or maid;â€”
