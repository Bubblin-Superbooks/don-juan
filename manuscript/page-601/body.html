Said Juan: 'Whatsoever is to be
  Done, I 'll not quit her till she seems secure
Of present life a good deal more than we.'
  Quoth Johnson: 'Neither will I quite ensure;
But at the least you may die gloriously.'
  Juan replied: 'At least I will endure
Whate'er is to be borne—but not resign
This child, who is parentless, and therefore mine.'

Johnson said: 'Juan, we 've no time to lose;
  The child 's a pretty child—a very pretty—
I never saw such eyes—but hark! now choose
  Between your fame and feelings, pride and pity;—
Hark! how the roar increases!—no excuse
  Will serve when there is plunder in a city;—
I should be loth to march without you,</pre></div> </div>
