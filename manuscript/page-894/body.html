<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">A lover with caprices soft and dear,
That like to make a quarrel, when they can't
  Find one, each day of the delightful year;
Bewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,
And—what is worst of all—won't let you go:

The sort of thing to turn a young man's head,
  Or make a Werter of him in the end.
No wonder then a purer soul should dread
  This sort of chaste liaison for a friend;
It were much better to be wed or dead,
  Than wear a heart a woman loves to rend.
'T is best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,
If that a 'bonne fortune' be really 'bonne.'

And first, in the o'erflowing of her heart,
  Which really knew or thought it knew no guile,
She call'd her husband now and then apart,
