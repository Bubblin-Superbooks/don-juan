<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Fatal to bishops as to soldiers—these
Cossacques were all cut off as day was breaking,
  And found their lives were let at a short lease—
But perish'd without shivering or shaking,
  Leaving as ladders their heap'd carcasses,
O'er which Lieutenant-Colonel Yesouskoi
March'd with the brave battalion of Polouzki:—

This valiant man kill'd all the Turks he met,
  But could not eat them, being in his turn
Slain by some Mussulmans, who would not yet,
  Without resistance, see their city burn.
The walls were won, but 't was an even bet
  Which of the armies would have cause to mourn:
'T was blow for blow, disputing inch by inch,
For one would not retreat, nor t' other flinch.

Another column also suffer'd much:—
