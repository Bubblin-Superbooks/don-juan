<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Listening debates not very wise or witty,
Ere patriots their true country can remember;—
But there 's no shooting (save grouse) till September.

I 've done with my tirade. The world was gone;
  The twice two thousand, for whom earth was made,
Were vanish'd to be what they call alone—
  That is, with thirty servants for parade,
As many guests, or more; before whom groan
  As many covers, duly, daily, laid.
Let none accuse Old England's hospitality—
Its quantity is but condensed to quality.

Lord Henry and the Lady Adeline
  Departed like the rest of their compeers,
The peerage, to a mansion very fine;
  The Gothic Babel of a thousand years.
None than themselves could boast a longer line,
