<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">To his own circumstances, there might lie
Some difficulties, as in his own preference,
  Or that of her to whom he might apply:
That still he 'd wed with such or such a lady,
If that they were not married all already.

Next to the making matches for herself,
  And daughters, brothers, sisters, kith or kin,
Arranging them like books on the same shelf,
  There 's nothing women love to dabble in
More (like a stock-holder in growing pelf)
  Than match-making in general: 't is no sin
Certes, but a preventative, and therefore
That is, no doubt, the only reason wherefore.

But never yet (except of course a miss
  Unwed, or mistress never to be wed,
Or wed already, who object to this)
