Some went to prayers again, and made a vow
  Of candles to their saints—but there were none
To pay them with; and some look'd o'er the bow;
  Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one
That begg'd Pedrillo for an absolution,
Who told him to be damn'd—in his confusion.

Some lash'd them in their hammocks; some put on
  Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;
Some cursed the day on which they saw the sun,
  And gnash'd their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;
And others went on as they had begun,
  Getting the boats out, being well aware
That a tight boat will live in a rough sea,
Unless with breakers close beneath her lee.

The worst of all was, that in their condition,
