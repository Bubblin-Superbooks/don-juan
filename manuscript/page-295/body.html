<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The public mind,—so few are the elect;
And the new births of both their stale virginities
Have proved but dropsies, taken for divinities.

But let me to my story: I must own,
  If I have any fault, it is digression—
Leaving my people to proceed alone,
  While I soliloquize beyond expression;
But these are my addresses from the throne,
  Which put off business to the ensuing session:
Forgetting each omission is a loss to
The world, not quite so great as Ariosto.

I know that what our neighbours call 'longueurs'
  (We 've not so good a word, but have the thing
In that complete perfection which ensures
  An epic from Bob Southey every spring),
Form not the true temptation which allures
