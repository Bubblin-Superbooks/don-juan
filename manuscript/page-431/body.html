<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Of ladies who can not have their own way;
But though my turn will not be served with less,
  These don't express one half what I should say:
For what is stealing young ones, few or many,
To cutting short their hopes of having any?

The love of offspring 's nature's general law,
  From tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings;
There 's nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw
  Like an invasion of their babes and sucklings;
And all who have seen a human nursery, saw
  How mothers love their children's squalls and chucklings;
This strong extreme effect (to tire no longer
Your patience) shows the cause must still be stronger.

If I said fire flash'd from Gulbeyaz' eyes,
