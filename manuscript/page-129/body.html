But somebody or other rummaging,
  Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:

Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.

But I being fond of true philosophy,
  Say very often to myself, 'Alas!

  And if you had it o'er again—'t would pass—
So thank your stars that matters are no worse,
And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.'
