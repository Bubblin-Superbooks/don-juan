Another time he might have liked to see 'em,
But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigaeum.

There, on the green and village-cotted hill, is
  (Flank'd by the Hellespont and by the sea)
Entomb'd the bravest of the brave, Achilles;
  They say so (Bryant says the contrary):
And further downward, tall and towering still, is
  The tumulus—of whom? Heaven knows! 't may be
Patroclus, Ajax, or Protesilaus—
All heroes, who if living still would slay us.

High barrows, without marble or a name,
  A vast, untill'd, and mountain-skirted plain,
And Ida in the distance, still the same,
  And old Scamander (if 't is he) remain;
The situation seems still form'd for fame—
