Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell
  Such thoughts, and be the better when they 're over;
And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:
I recommend young ladies to make trial.

And then there are such things as love divine,
  Bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure,
Such as the angels think so very fine,
  And matrons who would be no less secure,
Platonic, perfect, 'just such love as mine;'
  Thus Julia saidâ€”and thought so, to be sure;
And so I 'd have her think, were I the man
On whom her reveries celestial ran.

Such love is innocent, and may exist
  Between young persons without any danger.
A hand may first, and then a lip be kist;
