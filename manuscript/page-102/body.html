<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">But to proceed—for there is more behind:
With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,
Young Juan slipp'd half-smother'd, from the bed.

He had been hid—I don't pretend to say
  How, nor can I indeed describe the where—
Young, slender, and pack'd easily, he lay,
  No doubt, in little compass, round or square;
But pity him I neither must nor may
  His suffocation by that pretty pair;
'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut
With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.

And, secondly, I pity not, because
  He had no business to commit a sin,
Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws,
  At least 't was rather early to begin;
But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws
