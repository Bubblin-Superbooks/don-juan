For any further answer that he found,
  So deep an anguish wrung Gulbeyaz' brow:
Her cheek turn'd ashes, ears rung, brain whirl'd round,
  As if she had received a sudden blow,
And the heart's dew of pain sprang fast and chilly

And some of us have felt thus 'all amort,'
  When things beyond the common have occurr'd;—
Gulbeyaz proved in that brief agony
What she could ne'er express—then how should I?
