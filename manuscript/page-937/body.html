<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">glass,
A lovely being, scarcely form'd or moulded,
A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;

Rich, noble, but an orphan; left an only
  Child to the care of guardians good and kind;
But still her aspect had an air so lonely!
  Blood is not water; and where shall we find
Feelings of youth like those which overthrown lie
  By death, when we are left, alas! behind,
To feel, in friendless palaces, a home
Is wanting, and our best ties in the tomb?

Early in years, and yet more infantine
  In figure, she had something of sublime
In eyes which sadly shone, as seraphs' shine.
  All youth—but with an aspect beyond time;
Radiant and grave—as pitying man's decline;
