But once there (if you doubt this, prithee try)
She keeps it for you like a true ally.

She cannot step as does an Arab barb,
  Or Andalusian girl from mass returning,
Nor wear as gracefully as Gauls her garb,
  Nor in her eye Ausonia's glance is burning;
Her voice, though sweet, is not so fit to warb—
  le those bravuras (which I still am learning
To like, though I have been seven years in Italy,
And have, or had, an ear that served me prettily);—

She cannot do these things, nor one or two
  Others, in that off-hand and dashing style
Which takes so much—to give the devil his due;
  Nor is she quite so ready with her smile,
Nor settles all things in one interview
