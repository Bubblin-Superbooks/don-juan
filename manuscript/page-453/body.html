<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">If true, 'tis no great lease of its own fire;
For no one, save in very early youth,
  Would like (I think) to trust all to desire,
Which is but a precarious bond, in sooth,
  And apt to be transferr'd to the first buyer
At a sad discount: while your over chilly
Women, on t' other hand, seem somewhat silly.

That is, we cannot pardon their bad taste,
  For so it seems to lovers swift or slow,
Who fain would have a mutual flame confess'd,
  And see a sentimental passion glow,
Even were St. Francis' paramour their guest,
  In his monastic concubine of snow;—
In short, the maxim for the amorous tribe is
Horatian, 'Medio tu tutissimus ibis.'

The 'tu' 's too much,—but let it stand,—the verse
