But Dante's Beatrice and Milton's Eve
Were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.

Some persons say that Dante meant theology
  By Beatrice, and not a mistressâ€”I,
Although my opinion may require apology,
  Deem this a commentator's fantasy,
Unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he
  Decided thus, and show'd good reason why;
I think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics
Meant to personify the mathematics.

Haidee and Juan were not married, but
  The fault was theirs, not mine; it is not fair,
Chaste reader, then, in any way to put
  The blame on me, unless you wish they were;
Then if you 'd have them wedded, please to shut
