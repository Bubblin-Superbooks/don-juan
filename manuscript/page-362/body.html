<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Is always much more splendid than a king:
The virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,
Are savingâ€”vice spares nothing for a rarity.

But for the destiny of this young troop,
  How some were bought by pachas, some by Jews,
How some to burdens were obliged to stoop,
  And others rose to the command of crews
As renegadoes; while in hapless group,
  Hoping no very old vizier might choose,
The females stood, as one by one they pick'd 'em,
To make a mistress, or fourth wife, or victim:

All this must be reserved for further song;
  Also our hero's lot, howe'er unpleasant
(Because this Canto has become too long),
  Must be postponed discreetly for the present;
I 'm sensible redundancy is wrong,
