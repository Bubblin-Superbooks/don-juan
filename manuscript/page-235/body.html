<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Titus the master, Antony the slave,
Horace, Catullus, scholars, Ovid tutor,
  Sappho the sage blue-stocking, in whose grave
All those may leap who rather would be neuter
  (Leucadia's rock still overlooks the wave)â€”
O, Love! thou art the very god of evil,
For, after all, we cannot call thee devil.

Thou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,
  And jestest with the brows of mightiest men:
Caesar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,
  Have much employ'd the muse of history's pen;
Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,
  Such worthies Time will never see again;
Yet to these four in three things the same luck holds,
They all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.

Thou mak'st philosophers; there 's Epicurus
