The goodliest soil of body and of mind.

I 'll not gainsay them; it is not my cue;
  I 'll leave them to their taste, no doubt the best:
An eye 's an eye, and whether black or blue,
  Is no great matter, so 't is in request,
'T is nonsense to dispute about a hueâ€”
  The kindest may be taken as a test.
The fair sex should be always fair; and no man,
Till thirty, should perceive there 's a plain woman.

And after that serene and somewhat dull
  Epoch, that awkward corner turn'd for days
More quiet, when our moon 's no more at full,
  We may presume to criticise or praise;
Because indifference begins to lull
  Our passions, and we walk in wisdom's</pre></div> </div>
