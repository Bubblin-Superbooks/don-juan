<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">For Europe ploughs in Afric like 'bos piger:'
But if I had been at Timbuctoo, there
No doubt I should be told that black is fair.

It is. I will not swear that black is white;
  But I suspect in fact that white is black,
And the whole matter rests upon eyesight.
  Ask a blind man, the best judge. You 'll attack
Perhaps this new position—but I 'm right;
  Or if I 'm wrong, I 'll not be ta'en aback:—
He hath no morn nor night, but all is dark
Within; and what seest thou? A dubious spark.

But I 'm relapsing into metaphysics,
  That labyrinth, whose clue is of the same
Construction as your cures for hectic phthisics,
  Those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame;
And this reflection brings me to plain physics,
