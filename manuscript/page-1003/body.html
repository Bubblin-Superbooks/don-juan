Discuss'd (he hated beer yclept the 'small')
  A mighty mug of moral double ale.

  Its kind attentions to their proper pale,
To name a thing in nomenclature rather
Perplexing for most virginsâ€”a child's father.

  For the Lord Henry, link'd with dogs and horses.

  Below stairs on the score of second courses;
Because, as suits their rank and situation,
  Those who in counties have great land resources
Have 'Public days,' when all men may carouse,
Though not exactly what 's call'd 'open house.'

But once a week or fortnight, uninvited
