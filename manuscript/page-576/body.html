I think I hear a little bird, who sings
  The people by and by will be the stronger:
The veriest jade will wince whose harness wrings
  So much into the raw as quite to wrong her
Beyond the rules of posting,—and the mob
At last fall sick of imitating Job.

At first it grumbles, then it swears, and then,
  Like David, flings smooth pebbles 'gainst a giant;
At last it takes to weapons such as men
  Snatch when despair makes human hearts less pliant.
Then comes 'the tug of war;'—'t will come again,
  I rather doubt; and I would fain say 'fie on 't,'
If I had not perceived that revolution
Alone can save the earth from hell's pollution.
