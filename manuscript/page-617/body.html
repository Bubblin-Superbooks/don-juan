To those who had felt the inconvenient state
  Of 'single blessedness,' and thought it good
(Since it was not their fault, but only fate,
  To bear these crosses) for each waning prude
To make a Roman sort of Sabine wedding,
Without the expense and the suspense of bedding.

Some voices of the buxom middle-aged
  Were also heard to wonder in the din
(Widows of forty were these birds long caged)
  'Wherefore the ravishing did not begin!'
But while the thirst for gore and plunder raged,
  There was small leisure for superfluous sin;
But whether they escaped or no, lies hid
In darkness—I can only hope they did.

Suwarrow now was conqueror—a match
