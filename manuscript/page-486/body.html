With such a clamour! I had thought it right
  That the young stranger should not lie alone,
And, as the quietest of all, she might
  With you, Dudu, a good night's rest have known;
But now I must transfer her to the charge
Of Lolahâ€”though her couch is not so large.'

Resulting from the scolding or the vision,
  Implored that present pardon might be shown
For this first fault, and that on no condition

Her future dreams should all be kept in hand.

She promised never more to have a dream,
