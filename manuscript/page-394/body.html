<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And huge tombs worseâ€”mankind, since Adam fell:
Methinks the story of the tower of Babel
Might teach them this much better than I 'm able.

Babel was Nimrod's hunting-box, and then
  A town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing,
Where Nabuchadonosor, king of men,
  Reign'd, till one summer's day he took to grazing,
And Daniel tamed the lions in their den,
  The people's awe and admiration raising;
'T was famous, too, for Thisbe and for Pyramus,
And the calumniated queen Semiramis.

That injured Queen by chroniclers so coarse
  Has been accused (I doubt not by conspiracy)
Of an improper friendship for her horse
  (Love, like religion, sometimes runs to heresy):
This monstrous tale had probably its source
