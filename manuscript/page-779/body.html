<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">For like an aged aunt, or tiresome friend,
A rigid guardian, or a zealous priest,
  My Muse by exhortation means to mend
All people, at all times, and in most places,
Which puts my Pegasus to these grave paces.

But now I 'm going to be immoral; now
  I mean to show things really as they are,
Not as they ought to be: for I avow,
  That till we see what 's what in fact, we 're far
From much improvement with that virtuous plough
  Which skims the surface, leaving scarce a scar
Upon the black loam long manured by Vice,
Only to keep its corn at the old price.

But first of little Leila we 'll dispose;
  For like a day-dawn she was young and pure,
Or like the old comparison of snows,
