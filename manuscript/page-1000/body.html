<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Ready for gaol, their place of convalescence;
There was a country girl in a close cap
  And scarlet cloak (I hate the sight to see, since—
Since—since—in youth, I had the sad mishap—
  But luckily I have paid few parish fees since):
That scarlet cloak, alas! unclosed with rigour,
Presents the problem of a double figure.

A reel within a bottle is a mystery,
  One can't tell how it e'er got in or out;
Therefore the present piece of natural history
  I leave to those who are fond of solving doubt;
And merely state, though not for the consistory,
  Lord Henry was a justice, and that Scout
The constable, beneath a warrant's banner,
Had bagg'd this poacher upon Nature's manor.

Now justices of peace must judge all pieces
