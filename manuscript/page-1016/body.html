<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Smile of Aurora's there was nought to pique
Or hope, or love, with any of the wiles
Which some pretend to trace in ladies' smiles.

'T was a mere quiet smile of contemplation,
  Indicative of some surprise and pity;
And Juan grew carnation with vexation,
  Which was not very wise, and still less witty,
Since he had gain'd at least her observation,
  A most important outwork of the city—
As Juan should have known, had not his senses
By last night's ghost been driven from their defences.

But what was bad, she did not blush in turn,
  Nor seem embarrass'd—quite the contrary;
Her aspect was as usual, still—not stern—
  And she withdrew, but cast not down, her eye,
Yet grew a little pale—with what? concern?
