But now their eyes and also lips were dry;
  The bloom, too, had return'd to Haidee's cheeks,
Her tears, too, being return'd into their fount,
She now kept house upon her own account.

Hence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,
  Which turn'd the isle into a place of pleasure;
The servants all were getting drunk or idling,
  A life which made them happy beyond measure.
Her father's hospitality seem'd middling,
  Compared with what Haidee did with his treasure;
'T was wonderful how things went on improving,
While she had not one hour to spare from loving.

Perhaps you think in stumbling on this feast
  He flew into a passion, and in fact
There was no mighty reason to be pleased;
