<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Achilles' self was not more grim and gory
Than thousands of this new and polish'd nation,
Whose names want nothing butâ€”pronunciation.

Still I 'll record a few, if but to increase
  Our euphony: there was Strongenoff, and Strokonoff,
Meknop, Serge Lwow, Arsniew of modern Greece,
  And Tschitsshakoff, and Roguenoff, and Chokenoff,
And others of twelve consonants apiece;
  And more might be found out, if I could poke enough
Into gazettes; but Fame (capricious strumpet),
It seems, has got an ear as well as trumpet,

And cannot tune those discords of narration,
  Which may be names at Moscow, into rhyme;
Yet there were several worth commemoration,
  As e'er was virgin of a nuptial chime;
Soft words, too, fitted for the peroration
