Farewell, too, dearest Julia!—(Here he drew
Her letter out again, and read it through.)

'And, oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear—
  But that 's impossible, and cannot be—
Sooner shall this blue ocean melt to air,
  Sooner shall earth resolve itself to sea,
Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!
  Or think of any thing excepting thee;
A mind diseased no remedy can physic
(Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick).

'Sooner shall heaven kiss earth (here he fell sicker),
  O, Julia! what is every other wo?
(For God's sake let me have a glass of liquor;
  Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)
Julia, my love! (you rascal, Pedro, quicker)—
