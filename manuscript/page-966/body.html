  To draw the bow, to ride, and speak the truth.
This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings—
  A mode adopted since by modern youth.
Bows have they, generally with two strings;
  Horses they ride without remorse or ruth;
At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,
But draw the long bow better now than ever.

The cause of this effect, or this defect,—
  'For this effect defective comes by cause,'-
Is what I have not leisure to inspect;
  But this I must say in my own applause,
Of all the Muses that I recollect,
  Whate'er may be her follies or her flaws
In some things, mine 's beyond all</pre></div> </div>
