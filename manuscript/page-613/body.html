Was here (as heretofore and since) let loose.

If here and there some transient trait of pity
  Was shown, and some more noble heart broke through
Its bloody bond, and saved perhaps some pretty
  Child, or an aged, helpless man or two—

  Where thousand loves, and ties, and duties grew?
Cockneys of London! Muscadins of Paris!
Just ponder what a pious pastime war is.

Think how the joys of reading a Gazette
  Are purchased by all agonies and crimes:
Or if these do not move you, don't forget
  Such doom may be your own in aftertimes.
