The horrid war-whoop and the shriller scream
  Rose still; but fainter were the thunders grown:
Of forty thousand who had mann'd the wall,
Some hundreds breathed—the rest were silent all!

In one thing ne'ertheless 't is fit to praise
  The Russian army upon this occasion,
A virtue much in fashion now-a-days,
  And therefore worthy of commemoration:
The topic 's tender, so shall be my phrase—
  Perhaps the season's chill, and their long station
In winter's depth, or want of rest and victual,
Had made them chaste;—they ravish'd very little.

Much did they slay, more plunder, and no less
  Might here and there occur some violation
In the other line;—but not to such excess
