<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Never could she survive that common loss;
But just suppose that moment should betide,
  I only say suppose itâ€”inter nos.
(This should be entre nous, for Julia thought
In French, but then the rhyme would go for naught.)

I only say suppose this supposition:
  Juan being then grown up to man's estate
Would fully suit a widow of condition,
  Even seven years hence it would not be too late;
And in the interim (to pursue this vision)
  The mischief, after all, could not be great,
For he would learn the rudiments of love,
I mean the seraph way of those above.

So much for Julia. Now we 'll turn to Juan.
  Poor little fellow! he had no idea
Of his own case, and never hit the true one;
