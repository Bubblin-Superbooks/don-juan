<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">But of the first, our little friend Don Juan
Walk'd o'er the walls of Ismail, as if nursed
  Amidst such scenes—though this was quite a new one
To him, and I should hope to most. The thirst
  Of glory, which so pierces through and through one,
Pervaded him—although a generous creature,
As warm in heart as feminine in feature.

And here he was—who upon woman's breast,
  Even from a child, felt like a child; howe'er
The man in all the rest might be confest,
  To him it was Elysium to be there;
And he could even withstand that awkward test
  Which Rousseau points out to the dubious fair,
'Observe your lover when he leaves your arms;'
But Juan never left them, while they had charms,

Unless compell'd by fate, or wave, or wind,
