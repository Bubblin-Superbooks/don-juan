<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Sleeps from the chivalry of this bright age;
And tradesmen, with long bills and longer faces,
Sigh—as the postboys fasten on the traces.

They and their bills, 'Arcadians both,' are left
  To the Greek kalends of another session.
Alas! to them of ready cash bereft,
  What hope remains? Of hope the full possession,
Or generous draft, conceded as a gift,
  At a long date—till they can get a fresh one—
Hawk'd about at a discount, small or large;
Also the solace of an overcharge.

But these are trifles. Downward flies my lord,
  Nodding beside my lady in his carriage.
Away! away! 'Fresh horses!' are the word,
  And changed as quickly as hearts after marriage;
The obsequious landlord hath the change restored;
