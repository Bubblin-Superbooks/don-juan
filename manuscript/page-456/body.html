<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Bills, beasts, and men, and—no! not womankind!
With one good hearty curse I vent my gall,
  And then my stoicism leaves nought behind
Which it can either pain or evil call,
  And I can give my whole soul up to mind;
Though what is soul or mind, their birth or growth,
Is more than I know—the deuce take them both!

  As after reading Athanasius' curse,
Which doth your true believer so much please:
  I doubt if any now could make it worse
O'er his worst enemy when at his knees,
  'Tis so sententious, positive, and terse,
And decorates the book of Common Prayer,
As doth a rainbow the just clearing air.

Gulbeyaz and her lord were sleeping, or
  At least one of them!—Oh, the heavy</pre></div> </div>
