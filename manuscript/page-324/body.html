In arms, at least, he stood, in act to spring
On the first foe whom Lambro's call might bring.

'Young man, your sword;' so Lambro once more said:
  Juan replied, 'Not while this arm is free.'
The old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,
  And drawing from his belt a pistol, he
Replied, 'Your blood be then on your own head.'
  Then look'd dose at the flint, as if to see
'T was fresh—for he had lately used the lock—
And next proceeded quietly to cock.

It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,
  That cocking of a pistol, when you know
A moment more will bring the sight to bear
  Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;
A gentlemanly distance, not too near,
