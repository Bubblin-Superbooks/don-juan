But now the town is going to be attack'd;
  Great deeds are doingâ€”how shall I relate 'em?
Souls of immortal generals! Phoebus watches
To colour up his rays from your despatches.

  O, ye less grand long lists of kill'd and wounded!

  When my poor Greece was once, as now, surrounded!
O, Caesar's Commentaries! now impart, ye

So beautiful, so fleeting, to the Muse.

And almost every day, in sad reality,
