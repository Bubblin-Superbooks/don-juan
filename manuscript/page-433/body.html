And yet she did not want to reach the moon,
  Like moderate Hotspur on the immortal page;
Her anger pitch'd into a lower tune,
  Perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age—
Her wish was but to 'kill, kill, kill,' like Lear's,
And then her thirst of blood was quench'd in tears.

A storm it raged, and like the storm it pass'd,
  Pass'd without words—in fact she could not speak;
And then her sex's shame broke in at last,
  A sentiment till then in her but weak,
But now it flow'd in natural and fast,
  As water through an unexpected leak;
For she felt humbled—and humiliation
Is sometimes good for people in her station

It teaches them that they are flesh and blood,
