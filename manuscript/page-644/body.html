<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Much too poetical: men should know why
They write, and for what end; but, note or text,
I never know the word which will come next.

So on I ramble, now and then narrating,
  Now pondering:—it is time we should narrate.
I left Don Juan with his horses baiting—
  Now we 'll get o'er the ground at a great rate.
I shall not be particular in stating
  His journey, we 've so many tours of late:
Suppose him then at Petersburgh; suppose
That pleasant capital of painted snows;

Suppose him in a handsome uniform,—
  A scarlet coat, black facings, a long plume,
Waving, like sails new shiver'd in a storm,
  Over a cock'd hat in a crowded room,
And brilliant breeches, bright as a Cairn Gorme,
