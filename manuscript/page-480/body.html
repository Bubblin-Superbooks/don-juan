Certainly agedâ€”what her years might be
  I know not, never counting past their teens;
But there she slept, not quite so fair to see,
  As ere that awful period intervenes
Which lays both men and women on the shelf,
To meditate upon their sins and self.

But all this time how slept, or dream'd, Dudu?
  With strict inquiry I could ne'er discover,
And scorn to add a syllable untrue;
  But ere the middle watch was hardly over,
Just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,
  And phantoms hover'd, or might seem to hover,
To those who like their company, about
The apartment, on a sudden she scream'd out:

And that so loudly, that upstarted all
