And with such hurry, that ere he could curb it
He had paid his neighbour's prayer with half a turbot.

This was no bad mistake, as it occurr'd,
  The supplicator being an amateur;
But others, who were left with scarce a third,
  Were angryâ€”as they well might, to be sure.
They wonder'd how a young man so absurd
  Lord Henry at his table should endure;
And this, and his not knowing how much oats
Had fallen last market, cost his host three votes.

  That he the night before had seen a ghost,
A prologue which but slightly harmonised
  With the substantial company engross'd
By matter, and so much materialised,
