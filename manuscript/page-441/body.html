<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Of whom all such as came of age were stow'd,
The former in a palace, where like nuns
  They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad,
When she, whose turn it was, was wed at once,
  Sometimes at six years oldâ€”though it seems odd,
'T is true; the reason is, that the Bashaw
Must make a present to his sire in law.

His sons were kept in prison, till they grew
  Of years to fill a bowstring or the throne,
One or the other, but which of the two
  Could yet be known unto the fates alone;
Meantime the education they went through
  Was princely, as the proofs have always shown:
So that the heir apparent still was found
No less deserving to be hang'd than crown'd.

His majesty saluted his fourth spouse
