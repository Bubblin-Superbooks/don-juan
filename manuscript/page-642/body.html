<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Like all the worlds before, which have been hurl'd
First out of, and then back again to chaos,
The superstratum which will overlay us.

So Cuvier says;â€”and then shall come again
  Unto the new creation, rising out
From our old crash, some mystic, ancient strain
  Of things destroy'd and left in airy doubt:
Like to the notions we now entertain
  Of Titans, giants, fellows of about
Some hundred feet in height, not to say miles,
And mammoths, and your winged crocodiles.

Think if then George the Fourth should be dug up!
  How the new worldlings of the then new East
Will wonder where such animals could sup!
  (For they themselves will be but of the least:
Even worlds miscarry, when too oft they pup,
