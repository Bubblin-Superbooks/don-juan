Though knives and forks clank'd round as in a fray,

Till some one, with a groan, exprest a wish
(Unheeded twice) to have a fin of fish.

  He started; and perceiving smiles around
Broadening to grins, he colour'd more than once,
  And hastily—as nothing can confound
A wise man more than laughter from a dunce—
