<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">To rhyme at noon—when I have other things
To think of, if I ever think—I say
  I feel some chilly midnight shudderings,
And prudently postpone, until mid-day,
  Treating a topic which, alas! but brings
Shadows;—but you must be in my condition
Before you learn to call this superstition.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
