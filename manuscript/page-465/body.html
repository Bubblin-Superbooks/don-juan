<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Of sentimental friendship, there were three,
Lolah, Katinka, and Dudu; in short
  (To save description), fair as fair can be
Were they, according to the best report,
  Though differing in stature and degree,
And clime and time, and country and complexion;
They all alike admired their new connection.

Lolah was dusk as India and as warm;
  Katinka was a Georgian, white and red,
With great blue eyes, a lovely hand and arm,
  And feet so small they scarce seem'd made to tread,
But rather skim the earth; while Dudu's form
  Look'd more adapted to be put to bed,
Being somewhat large, and languishing, and lazy,
Yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy.

A kind of sleepy Venus seem'd Dudu,
