<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Or, roughly treading on the 'courtier's kibes'
With clownish heel, your popular circulation
Feeds you by printing half the realm's starvation;—

O, ye great authors!—'Apropos des bottes,'-
  I have forgotten what I meant to say,
As sometimes have been greater sages' lots;
  'T was something calculated to allay
All wrath in barracks, palaces, or cots:
  Certes it would have been but thrown away,
And that 's one comfort for my lost advice,
Although no doubt it was beyond all price.

But let it go:—it will one day be found
  With other relics of 'a former world,'
When this world shall be former, underground,
  Thrown topsy-turvy, twisted, crisp'd, and curl'd,
Baked, fried, or burnt, turn'd inside-out, or drown'd,
