      Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
        On Suli's rock, and Parga's shore,
      Exists the remnant of a line
        Such as the Doric mothers bore;
      And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,
      The Heracleidan blood might own.

      Trust not for freedom to the Franks—
        They have a king who buys and sells;
      In native swords, and native ranks,
        The only hope of courage dwells;
      But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,
      Would break your shield, however broad.

      Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
        Our virgins dance beneath the shade—
