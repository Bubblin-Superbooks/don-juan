<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">For that 's the phrase that settles all things now,
Meaning a virgin's first blush at a rout,
  And all her points as thorough-bred to show:
And I assure you, that like virgin honey
Tastes their first season (mostly if they have money).

How all the needy honourable misters,
  Each out-at-elbow peer, or desperate dandy,
The watchful mothers, and the careful sisters
  (Who, by the by, when clever, are more handy
At making matches, where ''t is gold that glisters,'
  Than their he relatives), like flies o'er candy
Buzz round 'the Fortune' with their busy battery,
To turn her head with waltzing and with flattery!

Each aunt, each cousin, hath her speculation;
  Nay, married dames will now and then discover
Such pure disinterestedness of passion,
