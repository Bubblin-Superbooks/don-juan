<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">I have seen Joanna Southcote—I have seen—
The House of Commons turn'd to a tax-trap—
  I have seen that sad affair of the late Queen—
I have seen crowns worn instead of a fool's cap—
  I have seen a Congress doing all that 's mean—
I have seen some nations like o'erloaded asses
Kick off their burthens, meaning the high classes.

I have seen small poets, and great prosers, and
  Interminable—not eternal—speakers—
I have seen the funds at war with house and land—
  I have seen the country gentlemen turn squeakers—
I have seen the people ridden o'er like sand
  By slaves on horseback—I have seen malt liquors
Exchanged for 'thin potations' by John Bull—
I have seen john half detect himself a fool.-

But 'carpe diem,' Juan, 'carpe, carpe!'
