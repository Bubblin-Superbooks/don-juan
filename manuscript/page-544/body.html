And, strange to say, they found some consolation
In this—for females like exaggeration.

And then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,
  They parted for the present—these to await,
According to the artillery's hits or misses,
  What sages call Chance, Providence, or Fate
(Uncertainty is one of many blisses,
  A mortgage on Humanity's estate)—
While their beloved friends began to arm,
To burn a town which never did them harm.

Suwarrow,—who but saw things in the gross,
  Being much too gross to see them in detail,
Who calculated life as so much dross,
  And as the wind a widow'd nation's wail,
And cared as little for his army's loss
