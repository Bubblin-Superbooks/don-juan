<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Though nameless in our language:—we retort
The fact for words, and let the French translate
That awful yawn which sleep can not abate.

The elderly walk'd through the library,
  And tumbled books, or criticised the pictures,
Or saunter'd through the gardens piteously,
  And made upon the hot-house several strictures,
Or rode a nag which trotted not too high,
  Or on the morning papers read their lectures,
Or on the watch their longing eyes would fix,
Longing at sixty for the hour of six.

But none were 'gene:' the great hour of union
  Was rung by dinner's knell; till then all were
Masters of their own time—or in communion,
  Or solitary, as they chose to bear
The hours, which how to pass is but to few known.
