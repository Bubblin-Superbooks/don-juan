With a young benefactress,—so was she,
Just in the way we very often see.

And every day by daybreak—rather early
  For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest—
She came into the cave, but it was merely
  To see her bird reposing in his nest;
And she would softly stir his locks so curly,
  Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,
Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,
As o'er a bed of roses the sweet south.

And every morn his colour freshlier came,
  And every day help'd on his convalescence;
'T was well, because health in the human frame
  Is pleasant, besides being true love's essence,
For health and idleness to passion's flame
