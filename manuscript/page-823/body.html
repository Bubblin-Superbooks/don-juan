Poor thing! How frequently, by me and others,
It hath been stirr'd up till its smoke quite smothers!

I 'll have another figure in a trice:—
  What say you to a bottle of champagne?
Frozen into a very vinous ice,
  Which leaves few drops of that immortal rain,
Yet in the very centre, past all price,
  About a liquid glassful will remain;
And this is stronger than the strongest grape
Could e'er express in its expanded shape:

'T is the whole spirit brought to a quintessence;
  And thus the chilliest aspects may concentre
A hidden nectar under a cold presence.
  And such are many—though I only meant her
From whom I now deduce these moral lessons,
