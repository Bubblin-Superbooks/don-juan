The paths, o'er which the far festoon entwines
  The red grape in the sunny lands of song,
Hath yet a purchased choice of choicest wines;
  The claret light, and the Madeira strong.
If Britain mourn her bleakness, we can tell her,
The very best of vineyards is the cellar.

Then, if she hath not that serene decline
  Which makes the southern autumn's day appear
As if 't would to a second spring resign
  The season, rather than to winter drear,
Of in-door comforts still she hath a mine,—
  The sea-coal fires the 'earliest of the year;'
Without doors, too, she may compete in mellow,
As what is lost in green is gain'd in yellow.

And for the effeminate villeggiatura—
