Immoral conduct by the fancied sway
  Your system feigns o'er the controulless core
Of human hearts, than all the long array

At best, no better than a go-between.

And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,
  Until too late for useful conversation;
The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,

A little still she strove, and much repented
And whispering 'I will ne'er consent'—consented.
