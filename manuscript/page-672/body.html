  Know little more of love than what is sung
In rhymes, or dreamt (for fancy will play tricks)
  In visions of those skies from whence Love sprung.
Some reckon women by their suns or years,
I rather think the moon should date the dears.

And why? because she 's changeable and chaste.
  I know no other reason, whatsoe'er
Suspicious people, who find fault in haste,
  May choose to tax me with; which is not fair,
Nor flattering to 'their temper or their taste,'
  As my friend Jeffrey writes with such an air:
However, I forgive him, and I trust
He will forgive himself;—if not, I must.

Old enemies who have become new friends
  Should so continue—'t is a point of</pre></div> </div>
