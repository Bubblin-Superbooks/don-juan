<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">There mails fast flying off like a delusion;
There barbers' blocks with periwigs in curl
  In windows; here the lamplighter's infusion
Slowly distill'd into the glimmering glass
(For in those days we had not got to gas);—

Through this, and much, and more, is the approach
  Of travellers to mighty Babylon:
Whether they come by horse, or chaise, or coach,
  With slight exceptions, all the ways seem one.
I could say more, but do not choose to encroach
  Upon the Guide-book's privilege. The sun
Had set some time, and night was on the ridge
Of twilight, as the party cross'd the bridge,—

That 's rather fine. The gentle sound of Thamis—
  Who vindicates a moment, too, his stream,
Though hardly heard through multifarious 'damme's'-
