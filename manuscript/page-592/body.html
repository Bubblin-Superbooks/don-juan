Where fights not to the last some desperate heart

  Over a heap of bodies, felt his heel
Seized fast, as if 't were by the serpent's head
  Whose fangs Eve taught her human seed to feel:
In vain he kick'd, and swore, and writhed, and bled,
  And howl'd for help as wolves do for a mealâ€”
The teeth still kept their gratifying hold,
As do the subtle snakes described of old.

A dying Moslem, who had felt the foot
