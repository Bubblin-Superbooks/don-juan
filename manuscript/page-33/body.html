Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,
Some for amusement, others for old grudges.

And then this best and weakest woman bore
  With such serenity her husband's woes,
Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,
  Who saw their spouses kill'd, and nobly chose
Never to say a word about them moreâ€”
  Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,
And saw his agonies with such sublimity,
That all the world exclaim'd, 'What magnanimity!'

No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,
  Is philosophic in our former friends;
'T is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous,
  The more so in obtaining our own ends;
And what the lawyers call a 'malus animus'
