Through Courland also, which that famous farce saw
  Which gave her dukes the graceless name of 'Biron.'
'T is the same landscape which the modern Mars saw,
  Who march'd to Moscow, led by Fame, the siren!
To lose by one month's frost some twenty years
Of conquest, and his guard of grenadiers.

Let this not seem an anti-climax:â€”'Oh!
  My guard! my old guard exclaim'd!' exclaim'd that god of day.
Think of the Thunderer's falling down below
  Carotid-artery-cutting Castlereagh!
Alas, that glory should be chill'd by snow!
  But should we wish to warm us on our way
Through Poland, there is Kosciusko's name
Might scatter fire through ice, like Hecla's</pre></div> </div>
