<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Even as a summer sky 's without a cloud:
I 'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,
A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.

'T was midnight—Donna Julia was in bed,
  Sleeping, most probably,—when at her door
Arose a clatter might awake the dead,
  If they had never been awoke before,
And that they have been so we all have read,
  And are to be so, at the least, once more.—
The door was fasten'd, but with voice and fist
First knocks were heard, then 'Madam—Madam—hist!

'For God's sake, Madam—Madam—here 's my master,
  With more than half the city at his back—
Was ever heard of such a curst disaster!
  'T is not my fault—I kept good watch—Alack!
Do pray undo the bolt a little faster—
