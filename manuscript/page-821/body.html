To those who were, or pass'd for meritorious,
Just to console sad glory for being glorious;

Which is in all respects, save now and then,
  A dull and desolate appendage. Gaze
Upon the shades of those distinguish'd men
  Who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,
The praise of persecution; gaze again
  On the most favour'd; and amidst the blaze
Of sunset halos o'er the laurel-brow'd,
What can ye recognise?—a gilded cloud.

There also was of course in Adeline
  That calm patrician polish in the address,
Which ne'er can pass the equinoctial line
  Of any thing which nature would express;
Just as a mandarin finds nothing fine,—
