Of tumbling first, and having in exchange
  Some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:
But Juan had been early taught to range
  The wilds, as doth an Arab turn'd avenger,
So that his horse, or charger, hunter, hack,
Knew that he had a rider on his back.

And now in this new field, with some applause,
  He clear'd hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,
And never craned, and made but few 'faux pas,'
  And only fretted when the scent 'gan fail.
He broke, 't is true, some statutes of the laws
  Of huntingâ€”for the sagest youth is frail;
Rode o'er the hounds, it may be, now and then,
And once o'er several country gentlemen.

But on the whole, to general admiration
