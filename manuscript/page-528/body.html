<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Is of all dreams the first hallucination;
So that the streets of colour'd lamps are full,
  That Sage (said john) surrenders at discretion
His purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,
To gratify, like a huge moth, this one sense.

'T is strange that he should farther 'damn his eyes,'
  For they are damn'd; that once all-famous oath
Is to the devil now no farther prize,
  Since John has lately lost the use of both.
Debt he calls wealth, and taxes Paradise;
  And Famine, with her gaunt and bony growth,
Which stare him in the face, he won't examine,
Or swears that Ceres hath begotten Famine.

But to the tale:â€”great joy unto the camp!
  To Russian, Tartar, English, French, Cossacque,
O'er whom Suwarrow shone like a gas lamp,
