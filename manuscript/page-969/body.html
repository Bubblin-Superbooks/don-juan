<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Those holier mysteries which the wise and just
Receive as gospel, and which grow more rooted,

  A visitant at intervals appears;
And what is strangest upon this strange head,

'Gainst such belief, there 's something stronger still
In its behalf, let those deny who will.

  The supper too discuss'd, the dames admired,
The banqueteers had dropp'd off one by oneâ€”
  The song was silent, and the dance expired:
The last thin petticoats were vanish'd, gone
