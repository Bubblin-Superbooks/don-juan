In lovers' parts his passion more to breathe,
Having no heart to show, he shows his teeth.'

Here Raucocanti's eloquent recital
  Was interrupted by the pirate crew,
Who came at stated moments to invite all
  The captives back to their sad berths; each threw
A rueful glance upon the waves (which bright all
  From the blue skies derived a double blue,
Dancing all free and happy in the sun),
And then went down the hatchway one by one.

They heard next dayâ€”that in the Dardanelles,
  Waiting for his Sublimity's firman,
The most imperative of sovereign spells,
  Which every body does without who can,
More to secure them in their naval cells,
