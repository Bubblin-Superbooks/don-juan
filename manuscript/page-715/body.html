<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Space to dispute what no one ever could
Decide, and every body one day will
Know very clearly—or at least lie still.

And therefore will I leave off metaphysical
  Discussion, which is neither here nor there:
If I agree that what is, is; then this I call
  Being quite perspicuous and extremely fair;
The truth is, I 've grown lately rather phthisical:
  I don't know what the reason is—the air
Perhaps; but as I suffer from the shocks
Of illness, I grow much more orthodox.

The first attack at once proved the Divinity
  (But that I never doubted, nor the Devil);
The next, the Virgin's mystical virginity;
  The third, the usual Origin of Evil;
The fourth at once establish'd the whole Trinity
