<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Passive obedience,â€”now raised up the head,
With flashing eyes and starting tears, and flung
Their arms, as hens their wings about their young,

O'er the promoted couple of brave men
  Who were thus honour'd by the greatest chief
That ever peopled hell with heroes slain,
  Or plunged a province or a realm in grief.
O, foolish mortals! Always taught in vain!
  O, glorious laurel! since for one sole leaf
Of thine imaginary deathless tree,
Of blood and tears must flow the unebbing sea.

Suwarrow, who had small regard for tears,
  And not much sympathy for blood, survey'd
The women with their hair about their ears
  And natural agonies, with a slight shade
Of feeling: for however habit sears
