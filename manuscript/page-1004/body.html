<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">(Thus we translate a general invitation),
All country gentlemen, esquired or knighted,
  May drop in without cards, and take their station
At the full board, and sit alike delighted
  With fashionable wines and conversation;
And, as the isthmus of the grand connection,
Talk o'er themselves the past and next election.

Lord Henry was a great electioneerer,
  Burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit;
But county contests cost him rather dearer,
  Because the neighbouring Scotch Earl of Giftgabbit
Had English influence in the self-same sphere here;
  His son, the Honourable Dick Dicedrabbit,
Was member for the 'other interest' (meaning
The same self-interest, with a different leaning).

Courteous and cautious therefore in his county,
