<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">For surely if we always could perceive
In the same object graces quite as killing
  As when she rose upon us like an Eve,
'T would save us many a heartache, many a shilling
  (For we must get them any how or grieve),
Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,
How pleasant for the heart as well as liver!

The heart is like the sky, a part of heaven,
  But changes night and day, too, like the sky;
Now o'er it clouds and thunder must be driven,
  And darkness and destruction as on high:
But when it hath been scorch'd, and pierced, and riven,
  Its storms expire in water-drops; the eye
Pours forth at last the heart's blood turn'd to tears,
Which make the English climate of our years.

The liver is the lazaret of bile,
