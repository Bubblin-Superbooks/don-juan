<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And knocking at the gate, 't was open'd wide,
And a magnificent large hall display'd
The Asian pomp of Ottoman parade.

I won't describe; description is my forte,
  But every fool describes in these bright days
His wondrous journey to some foreign court,
  And spawns his quarto, and demands your praiseâ€”
Death to his publisher, to him 't is sport;
  While Nature, tortured twenty thousand ways,
Resigns herself with exemplary patience
To guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations.

Along this hall, and up and down, some, squatted
  Upon their hams, were occupied at chess;
Others in monosyllable talk chatted,
  And some seem'd much in love with their own dress.
And divers smoked superb pipes decorated
