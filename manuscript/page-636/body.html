<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">rough,
I do not know;—I wish men to be free
As much from mobs as kings—from you as me.

The consequence is, being of no party,
  I shall offend all parties: never mind!
My words, at least, are more sincere and hearty
  Than if I sought to sail before the wind.
He who has nought to gain can have small art: he
  Who neither wishes to be bound nor bind,
May still expatiate freely, as will I,
Nor give my voice to slavery's jackal cry.

That 's an appropriate simile, that jackal;—
  I 've heard them in the Ephesian ruins howl
By night, as do that mercenary pack all,
  Power's base purveyors, who for pickings prowl,
And scent the prey their masters would attack all.
