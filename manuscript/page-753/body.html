<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Thou Morning Post, sole record of the panels
Broken in carriages, and all the phantasies
  Of fashion,â€”say what streams now fill those channels?
Some die, some fly, some languish on the Continent,
Because the times have hardly left them one tenant.

Some who once set their caps at cautious dukes,
  Have taken up at length with younger brothers:
Some heiresses have bit at sharpers' hooks:
  Some maids have been made wives, some merely mothers;
Others have lost their fresh and fairy looks:
  In short, the list of alterations bothers.
There 's little strange in this, but something strange is
The unusual quickness of these common changes.

Talk not of seventy years as age; in seven
