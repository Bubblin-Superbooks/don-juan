Napoleon on his bold and bloody track,
  It happen'd was himself beat back just now;
He was a jolly fellow, and could crack
  His jest alike in face of friend or foe,
Though life, and death, and victory were at stake;
But here it seem'd his jokes had ceased to take:

For having thrown himself into a ditch,
  Follow'd in haste by various grenadiers,
Whose blood the puddle greatly did enrich,
  He climb'd to where the parapet appears;
But there his project reach'd its utmost pitch
  ('Mongst other deaths the General Ribaupierre's
Was much regretted), for the Moslem men
Threw them all down into the ditch again.

And had it not been for some stray troops landing
