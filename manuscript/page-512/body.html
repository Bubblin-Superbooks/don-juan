<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">While two and twenty cannon duly set
Rose over the town's right side, in bristling tier,
Forty feet high, upon a cavalier.

But from the river the town 's open quite,
  Because the Turks could never be persuaded
A Russian vessel e'er would heave in sight;
  And such their creed was, till they were invaded,
When it grew rather late to set things right.
  But as the Danube could not well be waded,
They look'd upon the Muscovite flotilla,
And only shouted, 'Allah!' and 'Bis Millah!'

The Russians now were ready to attack:
  But oh, ye goddesses of war and glory!
How shall I spell the name of each Cossacque
  Who were immortal, could one tell their story?
Alas! what to their memory can lack?
