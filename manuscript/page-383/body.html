And horrid was the contrast to the view—
  But let me quit the theme; as such things claim
Perhaps even more attention than is due
  From me: I gazed (as oft I have gazed the same)
To try if I could wrench aught out of death
Which should confirm, or shake, or make a faith;

But it was all a mystery. Here we are,
  And there we go:—but where? five bits of lead,
Or three, or two, or one, send very far!
  And is this blood, then, form'd but to be shed?
Can every element our elements mar?
  And air—earth—water—fire live—and we dead?
We whose minds comprehend all things? No more;
But let us to the story as before.
