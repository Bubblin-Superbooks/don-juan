With 'Tu mi chamas's' from Portingale,
To soothe our ears, lest Italy should fail.

  Heart-ballads of Green Erin or Gray Highlands,
That bring Lochaber back to eyes that roam
  O'er far Atlantic continents or islands,
The calentures of music which o'ercome
  All mountaineers with dreams that they are nigh lands,
No more to be beheld but in such visions—

Made epigrams occasionally too
  Upon her friends, as everybody</pre></div> </div>
