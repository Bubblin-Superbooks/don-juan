<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Into a camp: I know that nought so bothers
The hearts of the heroic on a charge,
As leaving a small family at large.

'But these are but two Turkish ladies, who
  With their attendant aided our escape,
And afterwards accompanied us through
  A thousand perils in this dubious shape.
To me this kind of life is not so new;
  To them, poor things, it is an awkward scrape.
I therefore, if you wish me to fight freely,
Request that they may both be used genteelly.'

Meantime these two poor girls, with swimming eyes,
  Look'd on as if in doubt if they could trust
Their own protectors; nor was their surprise
  Less than their grief (and truly not less just)
To see an old man, rather wild than wise
