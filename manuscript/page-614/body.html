<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Are hints as good as sermons, or as rhymes.
Read your own hearts and Ireland's present story,
Then feed her famine fat with Wellesley's glory.

But still there is unto a patriot nation,
  Which loves so well its country and its king,
A subject of sublimest exultation—
  Bear it, ye Muses, on your brightest wing!
Howe'er the mighty locust, Desolation,
  Strip your green fields, and to your harvests cling,
Gaunt famine never shall approach the throne—
Though Ireland starve, great George weighs twenty stone.

But let me put an end unto my theme:
  There was an end of Ismail—hapless town!
Far flash'd her burning towers o'er Danube's stream,
  And redly ran his blushing waters</pre></div> </div>
