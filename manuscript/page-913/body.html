<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Of such a sentimental situation?
You 'll never guess, I 'll bet you millions, milliards—
It all sprung from a harmless game at billiards.

'T is strange,—but true; for truth is always strange;
  Stranger than fiction; if it could be told,
How much would novels gain by the exchange!
  How differently the world would men behold!
How oft would vice and virtue places change!
  The new world would be nothing to the old,
If some Columbus of the moral seas
Would show mankind their souls' antipodes.

What 'antres vast and deserts idle' then
  Would be discover'd in the human soul!
What icebergs in the hearts of mighty men,
  With self-love in the centre as their pole!
What Anthropophagi are nine of ten
