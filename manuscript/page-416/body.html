And said, 'It grieved him, but he could not stoop
To any shoe, unless it shod the Pope.'

Baba, indignant at this ill-timed pride,
  Made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat
He mutter'd (but the last was given aside)
  About a bow-stringâ€”quite in vain; not yet
Would Juan bend, though 't were to Mahomet's bride:
  There 's nothing in the world like etiquette
In kingly chambers or imperial halls,
As also at the race and county balls.

He stood like Atlas, with a world of words
  About his ears, and nathless would not bend:
The blood of all his line 's Castilian lords
  Boil'd in his veins, and rather than descend
To stain his pedigree a thousand swords
