<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">So call'd; the Antic long hath ceased to hear,
But still he smiles; and whether near or far,
  He strips from man that mantle (far more dear
Than even the tailor's), his incarnate skin,
White, black, or copper—the dead bones will grin.

And thus Death laughs,—it is sad merriment,
  But still it is so; and with such example
Why should not Life be equally content
  With his superior, in a smile to trample
Upon the nothings which are daily spent
  Like bubbles on an ocean much less ample
Than the eternal deluge, which devours
Suns as rays—worlds like atoms—years like hours?

'To be, or not to be? that is the question,'
  Says Shakspeare, who just now is much in fashion.
I am neither Alexander nor Hephaestion,
