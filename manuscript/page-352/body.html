Could stir his pulse, or make his faith feel brittle;
Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little.

No matter; we should ne'er too much enquire,
  But facts are facts: no knight could be more true,
And firmer faith no ladyeâ€”love desire;
  We will omit the proofs, save one or two:
'T is said no one in hand 'can hold a fire
  By thought of frosty Caucasus;' but few,
I really think; yet Juan's then ordeal
Was more triumphant, and not much less real.

Here I might enter on a chaste description,
  Having withstood temptation in my youth,
But hear that several people take exception
  At the first two books having too much truth;
Therefore I 'll make Don Juan leave the ship soon,
