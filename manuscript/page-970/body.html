<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Like fleecy Clouds into the sky retired,
And nothing brighter gleam'd through the saloon
Than dying tapers—and the peeping moon.

The evaporation of a joyous day
  Is like the last glass of champagne, without
The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;
  Or like a system coupled with a doubt;
Or like a soda bottle when its spray
  Has sparkled and let half its spirit out;
Or like a billow left by storms behind,
Without the animation of the wind;

Or like an opiate, which brings troubled rest,
  Or none; or like—like nothing that I know
Except itself;—such is the human breast;
  A thing, of which similitudes can show
No real likeness,—like the old Tyrian vest
