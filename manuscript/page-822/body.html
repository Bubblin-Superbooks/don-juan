Perhaps we have borrow'd this from the Chinese—

Perhaps from Horace: his 'Nil admirari'
  Was what he call'd the 'Art of Happiness;'
An art on which the artists greatly vary,
  And have not yet attain'd to much success.

  Indifference certes don't produce distress;
And rash enthusiasm in good society
Were nothing but a moral inebriety.

As a volcano holds the lava more
  Within—et caetera. Shall I go on?—No!
I hate to hunt down a tired metaphor,
