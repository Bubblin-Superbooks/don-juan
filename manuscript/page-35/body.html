But scarce a fee was paid on either side
Before, unluckily, Don Jose died.

He died: and most unluckily, because,

To public feeling, which on this occasion
Was manifested in a great sensation.

  The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:
His house was sold, his servants sent away,
  A Jew took one of his two mistresses,
A priest the otherâ€”at least so they say:
