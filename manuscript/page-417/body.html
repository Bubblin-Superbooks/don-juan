At length perceiving the 'foot' could not stand,
Baba proposed that he should kiss the hand.

  A half-way house of diplomatic rest,
Where they might meet in much more peaceful guise;
  And Juan now his willingness exprest
To use all fit and proper courtesies,

For through the South the custom still commands
The gentleman to kiss the lady's hands.

No lips e'er left their transitory trace;
  On such as these the lip too fondly lingers,
And for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,
