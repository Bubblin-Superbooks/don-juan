<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">That worse than worst of foes, the once adored
False friend, who held out freedom to mankind,
And now would chain them, to the very mind:—

Would she be proud, or boast herself the free,
  Who is but first of slaves? The nations are
In prison,—but the gaoler, what is he?
  No less a victim to the bolt and bar.
Is the poor privilege to turn the key
  Upon the captive, freedom? He 's as far
From the enjoyment of the earth and air
Who watches o'er the chain, as they who wear.

Don Juan now saw Albion's earliest beauties,
  Thy cliffs, dear Dover! harbour, and hotel;
Thy custom-house, with all its delicate duties;
  Thy waiters running mucks at every bell;
Thy packets, all whose passengers are booties
