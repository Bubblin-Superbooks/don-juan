And pour'd upon him and his sons like rain,
Which they resisted like a sandy plain

That drinks and still is dry. At last they perish'dâ€”
  His second son was levell'd by a shot;
His third was sabred; and the fourth, most cherish'd
  Of all the five, on bayonets met his lot;
The fifth, who, by a Christian mother nourish'd,
  Had been neglected, ill-used, and what not,
Because deform'd, yet died all game and bottom,
To save a sire who blush'd that he begot him.

The eldest was a true and tameless Tartar,
  As great a scorner of the Nazarene
As ever Mahomet pick'd out for a martyr,
  Who only saw the black-eyed girls in green,
Who make the beds of those who won't take quarter
