And (if let in) insists, in terms unhandsome,
On ready money, or 'a draft on Ransom.'

Whate'er thou takest, spare a while poor Beauty!
  She is so rare, and thou hast so much prey.
What though she now and then may slip from duty,
  The more 's the reason why you ought to stay.
Gaunt Gourmand! with whole nations for your booty,
  You should be civil in a modest way:
Suppress, then, some slight feminine diseases,
And take as many heroes as Heaven pleases.

  Where she was interested (as was said),
Because she was not apt, like some of us,
  To like too readily, or too high bred
To show it (points we need not now discuss)â€”
