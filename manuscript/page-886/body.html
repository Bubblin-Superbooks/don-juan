<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">To hunt our errors up with a good grace?
Consoling us with—'Would you had thought twice!
Ah, if you had but follow'd my advice!'

O job! you had two friends: one 's quite enough,
  Especially when we are ill at ease;
They are but bad pilots when the weather 's rough,
  Doctors less famous for their cures than fees.
Let no man grumble when his friends fall off,
  As they will do like leaves at the first breeze:
When your affairs come round, one way or t' other,
Go to the coffee-house, and take another.

But this is not my maxim: had it been,
  Some heart-aches had been spared me: yet I care not—
I would not be a tortoise in his screen
  Of stubborn shell, which waves and weather wear not.
'T is better on the whole to have felt and seen
