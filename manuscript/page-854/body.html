'Alas, poor ghost!'—What unexpected woes
Await those who have studied their bon-mots!

Firstly, they must allure the conversation
  By many windings to their clever clinch;
And secondly, must let slip no occasion,
  Nor bate (abate) their hearers of an inch,
But take an ell—and make a great sensation,
  If possible; and thirdly, never flinch
When some smart talker puts them to the test,
But seize the last word, which no doubt 's the best.

Lord Henry and his lady were the hosts;
  The party we have touch'd on were the guests:
Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts
  To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.
I will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts,
