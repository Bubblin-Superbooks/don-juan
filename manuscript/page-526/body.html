But as it was mere lust of power to o'er-arch all
  With its proud brow, it merits slight applause,
Save for its style, which said, all in a trice,
'You will take Ismail at whatever price.'

'Let there be light! said God, and there was light!'
  'Let there be blood!' says man, and there 's a seal
The fiat of this spoil'd child of the Night
  (For Day ne'er saw his merits) could decree
More evil in an hour, than thirty bright
  Summers could renovate, though they should be
Lovely as those which ripen'd Eden's fruit;
For war cuts up not only branch, but root.

Our friends the Turks, who with loud 'Allahs' now
  Began to signalise the Russ retreat,
Were damnably mistaken; few are slow
