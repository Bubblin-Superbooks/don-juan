<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Is all that life allows the luckiest sinner;
Pleasure (whene'er she sings, at least) 's a siren,
  That lures, to flay alive, the young beginner;
Lambro's reception at his people's banquet
Was such as fire accords to a wet blanket.

He—being a man who seldom used a word
  Too much, and wishing gladly to surprise
(In general he surprised men with the sword)
  His daughter—had not sent before to advise
Of his arrival, so that no one stirr'd;
  And long he paused to re-assure his eyes
In fact much more astonish'd than delighted,
To find so much good company invited.

He did not know (alas! how men will lie)
  That a report (especially the Greeks)
Avouch'd his death (such people never die),
