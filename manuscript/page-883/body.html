The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke, who loved 'tracasserie,'
Began to treat him with some small 'agacerie.'

She was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,
  Desirable, distinguish'd, celebrated
For several winters in the grand, grand monde.
  I 'd rather not say what might be related
Of her exploits, for this were ticklish ground;
  Besides there might be falsehood in what 's stated:
Her late performance had been a dead set
At Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.

This noble personage began to look
  A little black upon this new flirtation;
But such small licences must lovers brook,
  Mere freedoms of the female corporation.
Woe to the man who ventures a rebuke!
