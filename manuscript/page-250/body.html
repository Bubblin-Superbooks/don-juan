These to secure in this strong blowing weather,
He caged in one huge hamper altogether.

Then having settled his marine affairs,
  Despatching single cruisers here and there,
His vessel having need of some repairs,
  He shaped his course to where his daughter fair
Continued still her hospitable cares;
  But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,
And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,
His port lay on the other side o' the isle.

And there he went ashore without delay,
  Having no custom-house nor quarantine
To ask him awkward questions on the way
  About the time and place where he had been:
He left his ship to be hove down next day,
