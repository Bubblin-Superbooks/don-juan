Vibrate to the Eternal name. Hark! through

The columns were in movement one and all,
  But of the portion which attack'd by water,
Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall,
  Though led by Arseniew, that great son of slaughter,
As brave as ever faced both bomb and ball.

If he speak truth, she is Christ's sister, and
Just now behaved as in the Holy Land.

  Count Chapeau-Bras, too, had a ball between
His cap and head, which proves the head to be
  Aristocratic as was ever</pre></div> </div>
