And Mitford in the nineteenth century
Gives, with Greek truth, the good old Greek the lie.

Good people all, of every degree,
  Ye gentle readers and ungentle writers,
In this twelfth Canto 't is my wish to be
  As serious as if I had for inditers
Malthus and Wilberforce:—the last set free
  The Negroes and is worth a million fighters;
While Wellington has but enslaved the Whites,
And Malthus does the thing 'gainst which he writes.

I 'm serious—so are all men upon paper;
  And why should I not form my speculation,
And hold up to the sun my little taper?
  Mankind just now seem wrapt in mediation
On constitutions and steam-boats of vapour;
