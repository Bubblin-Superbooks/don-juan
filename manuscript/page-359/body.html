That taste is gone, that fame is but a lottery,
Drawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie.

O! 'darkly, deeply, beautifully blue,'
  As some one somewhere sings about the sky,
And I, ye learned ladies, say of you;
  They say your stockings are so (Heaven knows why,
I have examined few pair of that hue);
  Blue as the garters which serenely lie
Round the Patrician left-legs, which adorn
The festal midnight, and the levee morn.

Yet some of you are most seraphic creatures—
  But times are alter'd since, a rhyming lover,
You read my stanzas, and I read your features:
  And—but no matter, all those things are over;
Still I have no dislike to learned natures,
