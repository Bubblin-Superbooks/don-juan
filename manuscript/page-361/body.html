And there with Georgians, Russians, and Circassians,
Bought up for different purposes and passions.

  For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
Warranted virgin; beauty's brightest colours

  Who bade on till the hundreds reach'd eleven;
But when the offer went beyond, they knew

  Which the West Indian market scarce would bring;
Though Wilberforce, at last, has made it twice
  What 't was ere Abolition; and the thing
Need not seem very wonderful, for vice
