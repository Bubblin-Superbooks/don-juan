<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Each rose up at his own, and had to spare
What time he chose for dress, and broke his fast
When, where, and how he chose for that repast.

The ladies—some rouged, some a little pale—
  Met the morn as they might. If fine, they rode,
Or walk'd; if foul, they read, or told a tale,
  Sung, or rehearsed the last dance from abroad;
Discuss'd the fashion which might next prevail,
  And settled bonnets by the newest code,
Or cramm'd twelve sheets into one little letter,
To make each correspondent a new debtor.

For some had absent lovers, all had friends.
  The earth has nothing like a she epistle,
And hardly heaven—because it never ends.
  I love the mystery of a female missal,
Which, like a creed, ne'er says all it intends,
