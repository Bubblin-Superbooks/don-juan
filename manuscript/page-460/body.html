<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The galleries from room to room they walk'd,
A virgin-like and edifying throng,
  By eunuchs flank'd; while at their head there stalk'd
A dame who kept up discipline among
  The female ranks, so that none stirr'd or talk'd
Without her sanction on their she-parades:
Her title was 'the Mother of the Maids.'

Whether she was a 'mother,' I know not,
  Or whether they were 'maids' who call'd her mother;
But this is her seraglio title, got
  I know not how, but good as any other;
So Cantemir can tell you, or De Tott:
  Her office was to keep aloof or smother
All bad propensities in fifteen hundred
Young women, and correct them when they blunder'd.

A goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made
