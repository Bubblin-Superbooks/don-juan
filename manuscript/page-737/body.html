Had seen the worldâ€”which is a curious sight,
And very much unlike what people write.

Fair virgins blush'd upon him; wedded dames
  Bloom'd also in less transitory hues;
For both commodities dwell by the Thames,
  The painting and the painted; youth, ceruse,
Against his heart preferr'd their usual claims,
  Such as no gentleman can quite refuse:
Daughters admired his dress, and pious mothers
Inquired his income, and if he had brothers.

The milliners who furnish 'drapery Misses'
  Throughout the season, upon speculation
Of payment ere the honey-moon's last kisses
  Have waned into a crescent's coruscation,
Thought such an opportunity as this is,
