<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">When, being made her property at last,
Without more preface, in her blue eyes blending
  Passion and power, a glance on him she cast,
And merely saying, 'Christian, canst thou love?'
Conceived that phrase was quite enough to move

And so it was, in proper time and place;
  But Juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing
With Haidee's isle and soft Ionian face,
  Felt the warm blood, which in his face was glowing,
Rush back upon his heart, which fill'd apace,
  And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing;
These words went through his soul like Arab-spears,
So that he spoke not, but burst into tears.

She was a good deal shock'd; not shock'd at tears,
  For women shed and use them at their liking;
But there is something when man's eye appears
