<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The postboys have no reason to disparage
Their fee; but ere the water'd wheels may hiss hence,
The ostler pleads too for a reminiscence.

'T is granted; and the valet mounts the dickey—
  That gentleman of lords and gentlemen;
Also my lady's gentlewoman, tricky,
  Trick'd out, but modest more than poet's pen
Can paint,—'Cosi viaggino i Ricchi!'
  (Excuse a foreign slipslop now and then,
If but to show I 've travell'd; and what 's travel,
Unless it teaches one to quote and cavil?)

The London winter and the country summer
  Were well nigh over. 'T is perhaps a pity,
When nature wears the gown that doth become her,
  To lose those best months in a sweaty city,
And wait until the nightingale grows dumber,
