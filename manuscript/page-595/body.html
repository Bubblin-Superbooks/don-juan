<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And human lives are lavish'd everywhere,
As the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves
  When the stripp'd forest bows to the bleak air,
And groans; and thus the peopled city grieves,
  Shorn of its best and loveliest, and left bare;
But still it falls in vast and awful splinters,
As oaks blown down with all their thousand winters.

It is an awful topic—but 't is not
  My cue for any time to be terrific:
For checker'd as is seen our human lot
  With good, and bad, and worse, alike prolific
Of melancholy merriment, to quote
  Too much of one sort would be soporific;—
Without, or with, offence to friends or foes,
I sketch your world exactly as it goes.

And one good action in the midst of crimes
