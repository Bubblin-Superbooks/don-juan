Pointed to Juan who remain'd below.

Her presence was as lofty as her state;
  Her beauty of that overpowering kind,
Whose force description only would abate:
  I 'd rather leave it much to your own mind,
Than lessen it by what I could relate
  Of forms and features; it would strike you blind
Could I do justice to the full detail;
So, luckily for both, my phrases fail.

Thus much however I may add,—her years
  Were ripe, they might make six-and-twenty springs;
But there are forms which Time to touch forbears,
  And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things,
Such as was Mary's Queen of Scots; true—tears
  And love destroy; and sapping sorrow</pre></div> </div>
