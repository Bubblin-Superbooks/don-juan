Or like a wisp along the marsh so damp,
  Which leads beholders on a boggy walk,
He flitted to and fro a dancing light,
Which all who saw it follow'd, wrong or right.

But certes matters took a different face;
  There was enthusiasm and much applause,
The fleet and camp saluted with great grace,
  And all presaged good fortune to their cause.
Within a cannon-shot length of the place
  They drew, constructed ladders, repair'd flaws
In former works, made new, prepared fascines,
And all kinds of benevolent machines.

'T is thus the spirit of a single mind
  Makes that of multitudes take one direction,
As roll the waters to the breathing wind,
