<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Her majesty, who liked to gaze on youth
Almost as much as on a new despatch,
Glanced mildly, all the world was on the watch.

Though somewhat large, exuberant, and truculent,
  When wrothâ€”while pleased, she was as fine a figure
As those who like things rosy, ripe, and succulent,
  Would wish to look on, while they are in vigour.
She could repay each amatory look you lent
  With interest, and in turn was wont with rigour
To exact of Cupid's bills the full amount
At sight, nor would permit you to discount.

With her the latter, though at times convenient,
  Was not so necessary; for they tell
That she was handsome, and though fierce look'd lenient,
  And always used her favourites too</pre></div> </div>
