<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">At once the 'lie' and the 'elite' of crowds;
Who pass like water filter'd in a tank,
  All purged and pious from their native clouds;
Or paper turn'd to money by the Bank:
  No matter how or why, the passport shrouds
The 'passee' and the past; for good society
Is no less famed for tolerance than piety,â€”

That is, up to a certain point; which point
  Forms the most difficult in punctuation.
Appearances appear to form the joint
  On which it hinges in a higher station;
And so that no explosion cry 'Aroint
  Thee, witch!' or each Medea has her Jason;
Or (to the point with Horace and with Pulci)
'Omne tulit punctum, quae miscuit utile dulci.'

I can't exactly trace their rule of right,
