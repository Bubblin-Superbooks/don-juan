<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The first time thought quite terrible enough
To fly from, malgre all which people say
  Of glory, and all that immortal stuff
Which fills a regiment (besides their pay,
  That daily shilling which makes warriors tough)â€”
They found on their return the self-same welcome,
Which made some think, and others know, a hell come.

They fell as thick as harvests beneath hail,
  Grass before scythes, or corn below the sickle,
Proving that trite old truth, that life 's as frail
  As any other boon for which men stickle.
The Turkish batteries thrash'd them like a flail,
  Or a good boxer, into a sad pickle
Putting the very bravest, who were knock'd
Upon the head, before their guns were cock'd.

The Turks, behind the traverses and flanks
