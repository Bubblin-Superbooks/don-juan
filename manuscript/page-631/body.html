For my part, I 'll enlist on neither side,
  Until I see both sides for once agreeing.
For me, I sometimes think that life is death,
Rather than life a mere affair of breath.

'Que scais-je?' was the motto of Montaigne,
  As also of the first academicians:
That all is dubious which man may attain,
  Was one of their most favourite positions.
There 's no such thing as certainty, that 's plain
  As any of Mortality's conditions;
So little do we know what we 're about in
This world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.

It is a pleasant voyage perhaps to float,
  Like Pyrrho, on a sea of speculation;
But what if carrying sail capsize the boat?
