<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Of the three hundred grant but three,
      To make a new Thermopylae!

      What, silent still? and silent all?
        Ah! no;—the voices of the dead
      Sound like a distant torrent's fall,
        And answer, 'Let one living head,
      But one arise,—we come, we come!'
      'T is but the living who are dumb.

      In vain—in vain: strike other chords;
        Fill high the cup with Samian wine!
      Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,
        And shed the blood of Scio's vine!
      Hark! rising to the ignoble call—
      How answers each bold Bacchanal!

      You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,
