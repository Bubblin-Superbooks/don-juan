Flow'd from their bloodshot eyes, all red with strife,
They honour'd such determined scorn of life.

But the stone bastion still kept up its fire,
  Where the chief pacha calmly held his post:
Some twenty times he made the Russ retire,
  And baffled the assaults of all their host;
At length he condescended to inquire
  If yet the city's rest were won or lost;
And being told the latter, sent a bey
To answer Ribas' summons to give way.

In the mean time, cross-legg'd, with great sang-froid,
  Among the scorching ruins he sat smoking
Tobacco on a little carpet;—Troy
  Saw nothing like the scene around:—yet looking
With martial stoicism, nought seem'd to annoy
