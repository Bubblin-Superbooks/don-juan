<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">(So children cutting teeth receive a coral);
Meantime, they 'll doubtless please to recollect
  My epical pretensions to the laurel:
For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,
I 've bribed my grandmother's review—the British.

I sent it in a letter to the Editor,
  Who thank'd me duly by return of post—
I 'm for a handsome article his creditor;
  Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,
And break a promise after having made it her,
  Denying the receipt of what it cost,
And smear his page with gall instead of honey,
All I can say is—that he had the money.

I think that with this holy new alliance
  I may ensure the public, and defy
All other magazines of art or science,
