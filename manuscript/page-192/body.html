<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Around them (what I hope will never vanish)
The basquina and the mantilla, they
Seem at the same time mystical and gay.

But with our damsel this was not the case:
  Her dress was many-colour'd, finely spun;
Her locks curl'd negligently round her face,
  But through them gold and gems profusely shone:
Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace
  Flow'd in her veil, and many a precious stone
Flash'd on her little hand; but, what was shocking,
Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.

The other female's dress was not unlike,
  But of inferior materials: she
Had not so many ornaments to strike,
  Her hair had silver only, bound to be
Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,
