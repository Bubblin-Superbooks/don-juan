And thus your houri (it may be) disputes
Of these brief blossoms the immediate fruits.

Thus the young khan, with houris in his sight,
  Thought not upon the charms of four young brides,
But bravely rush'd on his first heavenly night.
  In short, howe'er our better faith derides,
These black-eyed virgins make the Moslems fight,
  As though there were one heaven and none besides,â€”
Whereas, if all be true we hear of heaven
And hell, there must at least be six or seven.

So fully flash'd the phantom on his eyes,
  That when the very lance was in his heart,
He shouted 'Allah!' and saw Paradise
  With all its veil of mystery drawn apart,
And bright eternity without disguise
