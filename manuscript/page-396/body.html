And 'Et sepulchri immemor struis domos'
Shows that we build when we should but entomb us.

At last they reach'd a quarter most retired,
  Where echo woke as if from a long slumber;
Though full of all things which could be desired,
  One wonder'd what to do with such a number
Of articles which nobody required;
  Here wealth had done its utmost to encumber
With furniture an exquisite apartment,
Which puzzled Nature much to know what Art meant.

It seem'd, however, but to open on
  A range or suite of further chambers, which
Might lead to heaven knows where; but in this one
  The movables were prodigally rich:
Sofas 't was half a sin to sit upon,
