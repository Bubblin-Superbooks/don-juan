<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">By a look scarce perceptibly askance
(Of weariness or scorn), began to feel
Some doubt how much of Adeline was real;

So well she acted all and every part
  By turns—with that vivacious versatility,
Which many people take for want of heart.
  They err—'t is merely what is call'd mobility,
A thing of temperament and not of art,
  Though seeming so, from its supposed facility;
And false—though true; for surely they 're sincerest
Who are strongly acted on by what is nearest.

This makes your actors, artists, and romancers,
  Heroes sometimes, though seldom—sages never;
But speakers, bards, diplomatists, and dancers,
  Little that 's great, but much of what is clever;
Most orators, but very few financiers,
