<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And Ocean slumber'd like an unwean'd child:
The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,
  The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild—
With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)
  What could they do? and hunger's rage grew wild:
So Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,
Was kill'd and portion'd out for present eating.

On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,
  And Juan, who had still refused, because
The creature was his father's dog that died,
  Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,
With some remorse received (though first denied)
  As a great favour one of the fore-paws,
Which he divided with Pedrillo, who
Devour'd it, longing for the other too.

The seventh day, and no wind—the burning sun
