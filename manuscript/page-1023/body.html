<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">But Juan, sitting silent in his nook,
Observing little in his reverie,
Yet saw this much, which he was glad to see.

The ghost at least had done him this much good,
  In making him as silent as a ghost,
If in the circumstances which ensued
  He gain'd esteem where it was worth the most.
And certainly Aurora had renew'd
  In him some feelings he had lately lost,
Or harden'd; feelings which, perhaps ideal,
Are so divine, that I must deem them real:â€”

The love of higher things and better days;
  The unbounded hope, and heavenly ignorance
Of what is call'd the world, and the world's ways;
  The moments when we gather from a glance
More joy than from all future pride or praise,
