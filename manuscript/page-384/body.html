Embark'd himself and them, and off they went thence
  As fast as oars could pull and water float;
They look'd like persons being led to sentence,
  Wondering what next, till the caique was brought
Up in a little creek below a wall
O'ertopp'd with cypresses, dark-green and tall.

Here their conductor tapping at the wicket
  Of a small iron door, 't was open'd, and
He led them onward, first through a low thicket
  Flank'd by large groves, which tower'd on either hand:
They almost lost their way, and had to pick itâ€”
  For night was dosing ere they came to land.
The eunuch made a sign to those on board,
Who row'd off, leaving them without a word.

As they were plodding on their winding way
