The Greek or Turkish Cohorn's ignorance
  Had palisado'd in a way you 'd wonder
To see in forts of Netherlands or France
  (Though these to our Gibraltar must knock under)—
Right in the middle of the parapet
Just named, these palisades were primly set:

So that on either side some nine or ten
  Paces were left, whereon you could contrive
To march; a great convenience to our men,
  At least to all those who were left alive,
Who thus could form a line and fight again;
  And that which farther aided them to strive
Was, that they could kick down the palisades,
Which scarcely rose much higher than grass blades.
