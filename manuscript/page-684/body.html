At home it might have given her some vexation;
  But where thermometers sunk down to ten,
Or five, or one, or zero, she could never
Believe that virtue thaw'd before the river.'

O for a forty-parson power to chant
  Thy praise, Hypocrisy! Oh for a hymn
Loud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt,
  Not practise! Oh for trumps of cherubim!
Or the ear-trumpet of my good old aunt,
  Who, though her spectacles at last grew dim,
Drew quiet consolation through its hint,
When she no more could read the pious print.

She was no hypocrite at least, poor soul,
  But went to heaven in as sincere a way
As any body on the elected roll,
