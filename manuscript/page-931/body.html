<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Was there chaste dame who had not in her head
Some drama of the marriage unities,
  Observed as strictly both at board and bed
As those of Aristotle, though sometimes
They turn out melodrames or pantomimes.

They generally have some only son,
  Some heir to a large property, some friend
Of an old family, some gay Sir john,
  Or grave Lord George, with whom perhaps might end
A line, and leave posterity undone,
  Unless a marriage was applied to mend
The prospect and their morals: and besides,
They have at hand a blooming glut of brides.

From these they will be careful to select,
  For this an heiress, and for that a beauty;
For one a songstress who hath no defect,
