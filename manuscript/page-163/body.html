When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,
  Survive through very desperate conditions,
Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife
  Nor shears of Atropos before their visions:
Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,
And makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity.

'T is said that persons living on annuities
  Are longer lived than others,—God knows why,
Unless to plague the grantors,—yet so true it is,
  That some, I really think, do never die;
Of any creditors the worst a Jew it is,
  And that 's their mode of furnishing supply:
In my young days they lent me cash that way,
Which I found very troublesome to pay.

'T is thus with people in an open boat,
