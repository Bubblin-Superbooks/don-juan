<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">But for my own peculiar superstition:
'Gainst rhyme I never should have knock'd my brows,
  Nor broken my own head, nor that of Priscian,
Nor worn the motley mantle of a poet,
If some one had not told me to forego it.

But 'laissez aller'—knights and dames I sing,
  Such as the times may furnish. 'T is a flight
Which seems at first to need no lofty wing,
  Plumed by Longinus or the Stagyrite:
The difficultly lies in colouring
  (Keeping the due proportions still in sight)
With nature manners which are artificial,
And rend'ring general that which is especial.

The difference is, that in the days of old
  Men made the manners; manners now make men—
Pinn'd like a flock, and fleeced too in their fold,
