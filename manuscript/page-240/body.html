For the first passion stays there such a while,
  That all the rest creep in and form a junction,
Life knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil,—
  Rage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction,—
So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,
Like earthquakes from the hidden fire call'd 'central,'

In the mean time, without proceeding more
  In this anatomy, I 've finish'd now
Two hundred and odd stanzas as before,
  That being about the number I 'll allow
Each canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;
  And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,
Leaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead
For them and theirs with all who deign to read.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
