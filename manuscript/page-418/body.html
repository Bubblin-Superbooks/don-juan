In contact; and sometimes even a fair stranger's
An almost twelvemonth's constancy endangers.

The lady eyed him o'er and o'er, and bade
  Baba retire, which he obey'd in style,
As if well used to the retreating trade;
  And taking hints in good part all the while,
He whisper'd Juan not to be afraid,
  And looking on him with a sort of smile,
Took leave, with such a face of satisfaction
As good men wear who have done a virtuous action.

When he was gone, there was a sudden change:
  I know not what might be the lady's thought,
But o'er her bright brow flash'd a tumult strange,
  And into her dear cheek the blood was brought,
Blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range
