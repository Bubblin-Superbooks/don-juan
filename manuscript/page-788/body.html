Of friendship which you may accept or pass,
  It does nor good nor harm being merely meant
To keep the wheels going of the higher class,
  And draw them nightly when a ticket 's sent:
And what with masquerades, and fetes, and balls,
For the first season such a life scarce palls.

A young unmarried man, with a good name
  And fortune, has an awkward part to play;
For good society is but a game,
  'The royal game of Goose,' as I may say,
Where every body has some separate aim,
  An end to answer, or a plan to layâ€”
The single ladies wishing to be double,
The married ones to save the virgins trouble.

I don't mean this as general, but particular
