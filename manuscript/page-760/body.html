O Gold! Why call we misers miserable?
  Theirs is the pleasure that can never pall;
Theirs is the best bower anchor, the chain cable
  Which holds fast other pleasures great and small.
Ye who but see the saving man at table,
  And scorn his temperate board, as none at all,
And wonder how the wealthy can be sparing,
Know not what visions spring from each cheese-paring.

Love or lust makes man sick, and wine much sicker;
  Ambition rends, and gaming gains a loss;
But making money, slowly first, then quicker,
  And adding still a little through each cross
(Which will come over things), beats love or liquor,
  The gamester's counter, or the statesman's</pre></div> </div>
