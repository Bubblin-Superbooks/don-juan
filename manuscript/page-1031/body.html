<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">A red lip with two rows of pearls beneath
Gleamed forth, as through the casement's ivy shroud
The moon peeped, just escaped from a grey cloud.

And Juan, puzzled but still curious, thrust
  His other arm forth. Wonder upon wonder!
It pressed upon a hard but glowing bust,
 Which beat as if there was a warm heart under.
He found, as people on most trials must,
  That he had made at first a silly blunder
And that in his confusion he had caught
Only the wall, instead of what he sought

The ghost, if ghost it were, seemed a sweet soul
  As ever lurked beneath a holy hood.
A dimpled chin, a neck of ivory stole
  Forth into something much like flesh and blood.
Back fell the sable frock and dreary cowl
