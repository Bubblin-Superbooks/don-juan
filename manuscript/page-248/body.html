Pursued o'er the high seas his watery journey,
And merely practised as a sea-attorney.

The good old gentleman had been detain'd
  By winds and waves, and some important captures;
And, in the hope of more, at sea remain'd,
  Although a squall or two had damp'd his raptures,
By swamping one of the prizes; he had chain'd
  His prisoners, dividing them like chapters
In number'd lots; they all had cuffs and collars,
And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.

Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,
  Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold
To his Tunis correspondents, save one man
  Toss'd overboard unsaleable (being old);
The restâ€”save here and there some richer one,
