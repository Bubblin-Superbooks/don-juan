Than that all-softening, overpowering knell,
The tocsin of the soulâ€”the dinner-bell.

Turkey contains no bells, and yet men dine;
  And Juan and his friend, albeit they heard
No Christian knoll to table, saw no line
  Of lackeys usher to the feast prepared,
Yet smelt roast-meat, beheld a huge fire shine,
  And cooks in motion with their clean arms bared,
And gazed around them to the left and right
With the prophetic eye of appetite.

  They follow'd close behind their sable guide,
Who little thought that his own crack'd existence
  Was on the point of being set aside:
He motion'd them to stop at some small distance,
