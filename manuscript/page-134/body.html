Thank Heaven I 've got no metaphor quite ready
(And so, my sober Muse—come, let 's be steady—

Chaste Muse!—well, if you must, you must)—the veil
  Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,
While the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,
  Flashes into the heart:—All sunny land
Of love! when I forget you, may I fail
  To—say my prayers—but never was there plann'd
A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,
Excepting the Venetian Fazzioli.

But to our tale: the Donna Inez sent
  Her son to Cadiz only to embark;
To stay there had not answer'd her intent,
  But why?—we leave the reader in the dark—
'T was for a voyage that the young man was meant,
