When poets say, 'I've written fifty rhymes,'
  They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;
In gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;
  At fifty love for love is rare, 't is true,
But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,
A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.

Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love,
  For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,
By all the vows below to powers above,
  She never would disgrace the ring she wore,
Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;
  And while she ponder'd this, besides much more,
One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,
Quite by mistakeâ€”she thought it was her own;

Unconsciously she lean'd upon the other,
