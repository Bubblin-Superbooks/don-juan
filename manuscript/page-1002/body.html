Which the poor thing at times essay'd to dry,
  For she was not a sentimental mourner
Parading all her sensibility,
  Nor insolent enough to scorn the scorner,
But stood in trembling, patient tribulation,
To be call'd up for her examination.

  The prize pig, ploughman, poachers; the men sent

Writing despatches) in their several stations,
Exulting in their brilliant lucubrations.
