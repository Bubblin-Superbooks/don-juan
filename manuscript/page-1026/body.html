<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Or tiptoe of an amatory Miss,
Gliding the first time to a rendezvous,
And dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe.

Again—what is 't? The wind? No, no—this time
  It is the sable friar as before,
With awful footsteps regular as rhyme,
  Or (as rhymes may be in these days) much more.
Again through shadows of the night sublime,
  When deep sleep fell on men, and the world wore
The starry darkness round her like a girdle
Spangled with gems—the monk made his blood curdle.

A noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,
  Which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,
Like showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,
  Sounding like very supernatural water,
Came over Juan's ear, which throbb'd, alas!
