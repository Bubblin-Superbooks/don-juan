<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Convinces all men, even a politician;
Or—what is just the same—it wearies out.
So the end 's gain'd, what signifies the route?

Why Adeline had this slight prejudice—
  For prejudice it was—against a creature
As pure as sanctity itself from vice,
  With all the added charm of form and feature,
For me appears a question far too nice,
  Since Adeline was liberal by nature;
But nature 's nature, and has more caprices
Than I have time, or will, to take to pieces.

Perhaps she did not like the quiet way
  With which Aurora on those baubles look'd,
Which charm most people in their earlier day:
  For there are few things by mankind less brook'd,
And womankind too, if we so may say,
