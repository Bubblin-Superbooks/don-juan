Recommendation; and to be well drest
Will very often supersede the rest.

And since 'there 's safety in a multitude
  Of counsellors,' as Solomon has said,
Or some one for him, in some sage, grave mood;—
  Indeed we see the daily proof display'd
In senates, at the bar, in wordy feud,
  Where'er collective wisdom can parade,
Which is the only cause that we can guess
Of Britain's present wealth and happiness;—

But as 'there 's safety' grafted in the number
  'Of counsellors' for men, thus for the sex
A large acquaintance lets not Virtue slumber;
  Or should it shake, the choice will more perplex—
Variety itself will more encumber.
