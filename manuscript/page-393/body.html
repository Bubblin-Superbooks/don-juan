A kind of death comes o'er us all alone,
Seeing what 's meant for many with but one.

A neat, snug study on a winter's night,
  A book, friend, single lady, or a glass
Of claret, sandwich, and an appetite,
  Are things which make an English evening pass;
Though certes by no means so grand a sight
  As is a theatre lit up by gas.
I pass my evenings in long galleries solely,
And that 's the reason I 'm so melancholy.

Alas! man makes that great which makes him little:
  I grant you in a church 't is very well:
What speaks of Heaven should by no means be brittle,
  But strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell
Their names who rear'd it; but huge houses fit illâ€”
