Because it then received no injury
  More than the cap; in fact, the ball could mean
No harm unto a right legitimate head:
'Ashes to ashes'—why not lead to lead?

Also the General Markow, Brigadier,
  Insisting on removal of the prince
Amidst some groaning thousands dying near,—
  All common fellows, who might writhe and wince,
And shriek for water into a deaf ear,—
  The General Markow, who could thus evince
His sympathy for rank, by the same token,
To teach him greater, had his own leg broken.

Three hundred cannon threw up their emetic,
  And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills
Like hail, to make a bloody diuretic.
