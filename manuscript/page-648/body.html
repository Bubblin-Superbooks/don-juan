<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Which none divine, and every one obeys,
Perhaps you may pick out some queer no meaning,
Of that weak wordy harvest the sole gleaning.

I think I can explain myself without
  That sad inexplicable beast of prey—
That Sphinx, whose words would ever be a doubt,
  Did not his deeds unriddle them each day—
That monstrous hieroglyphic—that long spout
  Of blood and water, leaden Castlereagh!
And here I must an anecdote relate,
But luckily of no great length or weight.

An English lady ask'd of an Italian,
  What were the actual and official duties
Of the strange thing some women set a value on,
  Which hovers oft about some married beauties,
Called 'Cavalier servente?'—a Pygmalion
