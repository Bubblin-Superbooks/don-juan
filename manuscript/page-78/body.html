<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">To those who could invent him a new pleasure:
Methinks the requisition 's rather hard,
  And must have cost his majesty a treasure:
For my part, I 'm a moderate-minded bard,
  Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);
I care not for new pleasures, as the old
Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.

O Pleasure! you are indeed a pleasant thing,
  Although one must be damn'd for you, no doubt:
I make a resolution every spring
  Of reformation, ere the year run out,
But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,
  Yet still, I trust it may be kept throughout:
I 'm very sorry, very much ashamed,
And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim'd.

Here my chaste Muse a liberty must takeâ€”
