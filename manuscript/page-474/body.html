<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Show'd Juan, or Juanna, through and through
This labyrinth of females, and each station
  Described—what 's strange—in words extremely few:
I have but one simile, and that 's a blunder,
For wordless woman, which is silent thunder.

And next she gave her (I say her, because
  The gender still was epicene, at least
In outward show, which is a saving clause)
  An outline of the customs of the East,
With all their chaste integrity of laws,
  By which the more a haram is increased,
The stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties
Of any supernumerary beauties.

And then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:
  Dudu was fond of kissing—which I 'm sure
That nobody can ever take amiss,
