Life's sad post-horses o'er the dreary frontier
Of age, and looking back to youth, give one tear;—

  Description; and I won't reflect,—that is,
If I can stave off thought, which—as a whelp
  Clings to its teat—sticks to me through the abyss
Of this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp
  Holds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss
Drains its first draught of lips:—but, as I said,
I won't philosophise, and will be read.

Juan, instead of courting courts, was courted,—
  A thing which happens rarely: this he owed
Much to his youth, and much to his reported
  Valour; much also to the blood he show'd,
Like a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,
