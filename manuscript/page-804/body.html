<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">An usurer could scarce expect much moreâ€”
But my best canto, save one on astronomy,
Will turn upon 'political economy.'

That is your present theme for popularity:
  Now that the public hedge hath scarce a stake,
It grows an act of patriotic charity,
  To show the people the best way to break.
My plan (but I, if but for singularity,
  Reserve it) will be very sure to take.
Meantime, read all the national debt-sinkers,
And tell me what you think of your great thinkers.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
