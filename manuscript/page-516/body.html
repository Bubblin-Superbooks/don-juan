A village of Moldavia's waste, wherein
He fell, immortal in a bulletin.

  Praise) if a man's name in a bulletin
May make up for a bullet in his body?
  I hope this little question is no sin,
Because, though I am but a simple noddy,
  I think one Shakspeare puts the same thought in
The mouth of some one in his plays so doting,
Which many people pass for wits by quoting.

Their Gallic names upon a glorious day;
  I 'd rather tell ten lies than say a word
Of truth;â€”such truths are treason; they betray
