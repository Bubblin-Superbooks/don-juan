A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,
Fighting, devotion, dust,—perhaps a name.

I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz—
  A pretty town, I recollect it well—
'T is there the mart of the colonial trade is
  (Or was, before Peru learn'd to rebel),
And such sweet girls—I mean, such graceful ladies,
  Their very walk would make your bosom swell;
I can't describe it, though so much it strike,
Nor liken it—I never saw the like:

An Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb
  New broke, a cameleopard, a gazelle,
No—none of these will do;—and then their garb!
  Their veil and petticoat—Alas! to dwell
Upon such things would very near absorb
