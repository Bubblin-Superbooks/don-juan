Then broke his packet, to see what was in 't,
  And having casually glanced it through,
Retired; and, as went out, calmly kiss'd her,
Less like a young wife than an aged sister.

He was a cold, good, honourable man,
  Proud of his birth, and proud of every thing;
A goodly spirit for a state divan,
  A figure fit to walk before a king;
Tall, stately, form'd to lead the courtly van
  On birthdays, glorious with a star and string;
The very model of a chamberlain—
And such I mean to make him when I reign.

But there was something wanting on the whole—
  I don't know what, and therefore cannot tell—
Which pretty women—the sweet souls!—call soul.
