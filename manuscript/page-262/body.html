He ask'd the meaning of this holiday;
  The vinous Greek to whom he had address'd
His question, much too merry to divine
The questioner, fill'd up a glass of wine,

And without turning his facetious head,
  Over his shoulder, with a Bacchant air,
Presented the o'erflowing cup, and said,
  'Talking 's dry work, I have no time to spare.'
A second hiccup'd, 'Our old master 's dead,
  You 'd better ask our mistress who 's his heir.'
'Our mistress!' quoth a third: 'Our mistress!—pooh!-
You mean our master—not the old, but new.'

These rascals, being new comers, knew not whom
  They thus address'd—and Lambro's visage fell—
And o'er his eye a momentary gloom
