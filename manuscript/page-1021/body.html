And then her dress—what beautiful simplicity
Draperied her form with curious felicity!

Meanwhile Sweet Adeline deserved their praises,
  By an impartial indemnification
For all her past exertion and soft phrases,
  In a most edifying conversation,

Their hideous wives, their horrid selves and dresses,
And truculent distortion of their tresses.

Her own but served to set off every joke,
