<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Albeit all human history attests
That happiness for man—the hungry sinner!-
Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.

Witness the lands which 'flow'd with milk and honey,'
  Held out unto the hungry Israelites;
To this we have added since, the love of money,
  The only sort of pleasure which requites.
Youth fades, and leaves our days no longer sunny;
  We tire of mistresses and parasites;
But oh, ambrosial cash! Ah! who would lose thee?
When we no more can use, or even abuse thee!

The gentlemen got up betimes to shoot,
  Or hunt: the young, because they liked the sport—
The first thing boys like after play and fruit;
  The middle-aged to make the day more short;
For ennui is a growth of English root,
