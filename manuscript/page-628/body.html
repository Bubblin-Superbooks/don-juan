Who fatten on their country's gore, and debts,
  Must be recited, and—without a bribe.
You did great things; but not being great in mind,
Have left undone the greatest—and mankind.

Death laughs—Go ponder o'er the skeleton
  With which men image out the unknown thing
That hides the past world, like to a set sun
  Which still elsewhere may rouse a brighter spring—
Death laughs at all you weep for:—look upon
  This hourly dread of all! whose threaten'd sting
Turns life to terror, even though in its sheath:
Mark how its lipless mouth grins without breath!

Mark how it laughs and scorns at all you are!
  And yet was what you are: from ear to ear
It laughs not—there is now no fleshy bar
