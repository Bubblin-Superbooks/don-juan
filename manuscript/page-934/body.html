Which says, 'Thou shalt not marry,' unless well:
  This he (as far as I can understand) meant.
'T is not my purpose on his views to dwell
  Nor canvass what so 'eminent a hand' meant;
But certes it conducts to lives ascetic,
Or turning marriage into arithmetic.

But Adeline, who probably presumed
  That Juan had enough of maintenance,
Or separate maintenance, in case 't was doom'd—
  As on the whole it is an even chance
That bridegrooms, after they are fairly groom'd,
  May retrograde a little in the dance
Of marriage (which might form a painter's fame,
Like Holbein's 'Dance of Death'—but 't is the same);—

But Adeline determined Juan's wedding
