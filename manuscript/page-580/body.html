<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">No common language; and besides, in time
Of war and taking towns, when many a shriek
  Rings o'er the dialogue, and many a crime
Is perpetrated ere a word can break
  Upon the ear, and sounds of horror chime
In like church-bells, with sigh, howl, groan, yell, prayer,
There cannot be much conversation there.

And therefore all we have related in
  Two long octaves, pass'd in a little minute;
But in the same small minute, every sin
  Contrived to get itself comprised within it.
The very cannon, deafen'd by the din,
  Grew dumb, for you might almost hear a linnet,
As soon as thunder, 'midst the general noise
Of human nature's agonising voice!

The town was enter'd. Oh eternity!-
