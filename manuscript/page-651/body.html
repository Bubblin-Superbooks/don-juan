<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Know not, since knowledge saw her branches stript
Of her first fruit; but how he falls and rises
Since, thou hast settled beyond all surmises.

Some call thee 'the worst cause of war,' but I
  Maintain thou art the best: for after all
From thee we come, to thee we go, and why
  To get at thee not batter down a wall,
Or waste a world? since no one can deny
  Thou dost replenish worlds both great and small:
With, or without thee, all things at a stand
Are, or would be, thou sea of life's dry land!

Catherine, who was the grand epitome
  Of that great cause of war, or peace, or what
You please (it causes all the things which be,
  So you may take your choice of this or that)â€”
Catherine, I say, was very glad to see
