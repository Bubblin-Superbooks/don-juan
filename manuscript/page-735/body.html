For downright rudeness, ye may stay at home;
  For true or false politeness (and scarce that
Now) you may cross the blue deep and white foam—
  The first the emblem (rarely though) of what
You leave behind, the next of much you come
  To meet. However, 't is no time to chat
On general topics: poems must confine
Themselves to unity, like this of mine.

In the great world,—which, being interpreted,
  Meaneth the west or worst end of a city,
And about twice two thousand people bred
  By no means to be very wise or witty,
But to sit up while others lie in bed,
  And look down on the universe with pity,—
Juan, as an inveterate</pre></div> </div>
