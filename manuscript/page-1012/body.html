As between English beef and Spartan broth—
And yet great heroes have been bred by both.

But of all nature's discrepancies, none
  Upon the whole is greater than the difference
Beheld between the country and the town,
  Of which the latter merits every preference
From those who have few resources of their own,
  And only think, or act, or feel, with reference
To some small plan of interest or ambition—
Both which are limited to no condition.

But 'en avant!' The light loves languish o'er
  Long banquets and too many guests, although
A slight repast makes people love much more,
  Bacchus and Ceres being, as we know
Even from our grammar upwards, friends of yore
