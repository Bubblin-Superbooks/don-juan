<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">'God made the country and man made the town,'
So Cowper says—and I begin to be
  Of his opinion, when I see cast down
Rome, Babylon, Tyre, Carthage, Nineveh,
  All walls men know, and many never known;
And pondering on the present and the past,
To deem the woods shall be our home at last

Of all men, saving Sylla the man-slayer,
  Who passes for in life and death most lucky,
Of the great names which in our faces stare,
  The General Boon, back-woodsman of Kentucky,
Was happiest amongst mortals anywhere;
  For killing nothing but a bear or buck, he
Enjoy'd the lonely, vigorous, harmless days
Of his old age in wilds of deepest maze.

Crime came not near him—she is not the child
