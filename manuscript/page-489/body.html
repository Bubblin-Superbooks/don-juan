<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Gulbeyaz rose from restlessness; and pale
As passion rises, with its bosom worn,
  Array'd herself with mantle, gem, and veil.
The nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,
  Which fable places in her breast of wail,
Is lighter far of heart and voice than those
Whose headlong passions form their proper woes.

And that 's the moral of this composition,
  If people would but see its real drift;â€”
But that they will not do without suspicion,
  Because all gentle readers have the gift
Of closing 'gainst the light their orbs of vision;
  While gentle writers also love to lift
Their voices 'gainst each other, which is natural,
The numbers are too great for them to flatter all.

Rose the sultana from a bed of splendour,
