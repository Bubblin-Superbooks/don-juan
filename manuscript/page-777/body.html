<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">So good an opportunity, no doubt:—
But the old marchioness some plan had hatch'd,
  As I 'll tell Aurea at to-morrow's rout:
And after all poor Frederick may do better—
Pray did you see her answer to his letter?'

Smart uniforms and sparkling coronets
  Are spurn'd in turn, until her turn arrives,
After male loss of time, and hearts, and bets
  Upon the sweepstakes for substantial wives;
And when at last the pretty creature gets
  Some gentleman, who fights, or writes, or drives,
It soothes the awkward squad of the rejected
To find how very badly she selected.

For sometimes they accept some long pursuer,
  Worn out with importunity; or fall
(But here perhaps the instances are fewer)
