<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The salmi, the consomme, the puree,
All which I use to make my rhymes run glibber
  Than could roast beef in our rough John Bull way:
I must not introduce even a spare rib here,
  'Bubble and squeak' would spoil my liquid lay:
But I have dined, and must forego, Alas!
The chaste description even of a 'becasse;'

And fruits, and ice, and all that art refines
  From nature for the service of the gout—
Taste or the gout,—pronounce it as inclines
  Your stomach! Ere you dine, the French will do;
But after, there are sometimes certain signs
  Which prove plain English truer of the two.
Hast ever had the gout? I have not had it—
But I may have, and you too, reader, dread it.

The simple olives, best allies of wine,
