That each pull'd different ways with many an oath,
'Arcades ambo,' id est—blackguards both.

Juan's companion was a Romagnole,
  But bred within the March of old Ancona,
With eyes that look'd into the very soul
  (And other chief points of a 'bella donna'),
Bright—and as black and burning as a coal;
  And through her dear brunette complexion shone
Great wish to please—a most attractive dower,
Especially when added to the power.

But all that power was wasted upon him,
  For sorrow o'er each sense held stern command;
Her eye might flash on his, but found it dim;
  And though thus chain'd, as natural her hand
Touch'd his, nor that—nor any handsome limb
