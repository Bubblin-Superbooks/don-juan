  A man like whom I hope we shan't see many soon;
They also set a glazed Westphalian ham on,
  Whereon Apicius would bestow his benison;
And then there was champagne with foaming whirls,
As white as Cleopatra's melted pearls.

Then there was God knows what 'a l'Allemande,'
  'A l'Espagnole,' 'timballe,' and 'salpicon'-
With things I can't withstand or understand,
  Though swallow'd with much zest upon the whole;
And 'entremets' to piddle with at hand,
  Gently to lull down the subsiding soul;
While great Lucullus' Robe triumphal muffles
(There 's fame) young partridge fillets, deck'd with truffles.

What are the fillets on the victor's brow
