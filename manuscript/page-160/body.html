<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,
For on such things the memory reposes
  With tendernessâ€”stood howling on the brink,
Knowing (dogs have such intellectual noses!),
  No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;
And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepp'd
Off, threw him in, then after him he leap'd.

He also stuff'd his money where he could
  About his person, and Pedrillo's too,
Who let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,
  Not knowing what himself to say, or do,
As every rising wave his dread renew'd;
  But Juan, trusting they might still get through,
And deeming there were remedies for any ill,
Thus re-embark'd his tutor and his spaniel.

'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,
