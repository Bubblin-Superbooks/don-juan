<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The dreary 'Fuimus' of all things human,
Must be declined, while life's thin thread 's spun out
Between the gaping heir and gnawing gout.

But heaven must be diverted; its diversion
  Is sometimes truculent—but never mind:
The world upon the whole is worth the assertion
  (If but for comfort) that all things are kind:
And that same devilish doctrine of the Persian,
  Of the two principles, but leaves behind
As many doubts as any other doctrine
Has ever puzzled Faith withal, or yoked her in.

The English winter—ending in July,
  To recommence in August—now was done.
'T is the postilion's paradise: wheels fly;
  On roads, east, south, north, west, there is a run.
But for post-horses who finds sympathy?
