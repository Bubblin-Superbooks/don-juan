Thy plagues, thy famines, thy physicians, yet tick,
  Like the death-watch, within our ears the ills
Past, present, and to come;—but all may yield
To the true portrait of one battle-field.

There the still varying pangs, which multiply
  Until their very number makes men hard
By the infinities of agony,
  Which meet the gaze whate'er it may regard—
The groan, the roll in dust, the all-white eye
  Turn'd back within its socket,—these reward
Your rank and file by thousands, while the rest
May win perhaps a riband at the breast!

Yet I love glory;—glory 's a great thing:—
  Think what it is to be in your old age
Maintain'd at the expense of your good king:
