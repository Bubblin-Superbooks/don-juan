<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">With flashing eyes and weapons: match'd with them,
The rudest brute that roams Siberia's wild
  Has feelings pure and polish'd as a gem,â€”
The bear is civilised, the wolf is mild;
  And whom for this at last must we condemn?
Their natures? or their sovereigns, who employ
All arts to teach their subjects to destroy?

Their sabres glitter'd o'er her little head,
  Whence her fair hair rose twining with affright,
Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead:
  When Juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight,
I shall not say exactly what he said,
  Because it might not solace 'ears polite;'
But what he did, was to lay on their backs,
The readiest way of reasoning with Cossacques.

One's hip he slash'd, and split the other's shoulder,
