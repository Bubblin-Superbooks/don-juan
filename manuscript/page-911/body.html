<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Upon me; whom no scandal could remove;
Who fought, and fight, in absence, too, my battles,
Despite the snake Society's loud rattles.

Whether Don Juan and chaste Adeline
  Grew friends in this or any other sense,
Will be discuss'd hereafter, I opine:
  At present I am glad of a pretence
To leave them hovering, as the effect is fine,
  And keeps the atrocious reader in suspense;
The surest way for ladies and for books
To bait their tender, or their tenter, hooks.

Whether they rode, or walk'd, or studied Spanish
  To read Don Quixote in the original,
A pleasure before which all others vanish;
  Whether their talk was of the kind call'd 'small,'
Or serious, are the topics I must banish
