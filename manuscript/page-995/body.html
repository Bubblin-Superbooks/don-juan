<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Of Juan's nervous feelings on that day.
Perhaps she merely had the simple project
  To laugh him out of his supposed dismay;
Perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it,
Though why I cannot sayâ€”at least this minute.

But so far the immediate effect
  Was to restore him to his self-propriety,
A thing quite necessary to the elect,
  Who wish to take the tone of their society:
In which you cannot be too circumspect,
  Whether the mode be persiflage or piety,
But wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,
On pain of much displeasing the gynocracy.

And therefore Juan now began to rally
  His spirits, and without more explanation
To jest upon such themes in many a sally.
