<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">To these? They are rags or dust. Where is the arch
Which nodded to the nation's spoils below?
  Where the triumphal chariots' haughty march?
Gone to where victories must like dinners go.
  Farther I shall not follow the research:
But oh! ye modern heroes with your cartridges,
When will your names lend lustre e'en to partridges?

Those truffles too are no bad accessaries,
  Follow'd by 'petits puits d'amour'â€”a dish
Of which perhaps the cookery rather varies,
  So every one may dress it to his wish,
According to the best of dictionaries,
  Which encyclopedize both flesh and fish;
But even sans 'confitures,' it no less true is,
There 's pretty picking in those 'petits puits.'

The mind is lost in mighty contemplation
