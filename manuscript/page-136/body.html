The great success of Juan's education,
Spurr'd her to teach another generation.

Juan embark'd—the ship got under way,
  The wind was fair, the water passing rough:
A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,
  As I, who 've cross'd it oft, know well enough;
And, standing upon deck, the dashing spray
  Flies in one's face, and makes it weather-tough:
And there he stood to take, and take again,
His first—perhaps his last—farewell of Spain.

I can't but say it is an awkward sight
  To see one's native land receding through
The growing waters; it unmans one quite,
  Especially when life is rather new:
I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,
