But now it seems he's right, his notion just,
No doubt a consolation to his dust.

Pythagoras, Locke, Socrates—but pages
   Might be filled up, as vainly as before,
With the sad usage of all sorts of sages,
   Who in his lifetime each was deemed a bore.
The loftiest minds outrun their tardy ages;
  This they must bear with and perhaps much more.
The wise man's sure when he no more can share it, he
Will have a firm post-obit on posterity.

If such doom waits each intellectual giant,
 We little people in our lesser way
To life's small rubs should surely be more pliant,
  And so for one will I, as well I may.
Would that I were less bilious—but oh fie on't!
