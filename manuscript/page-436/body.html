<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">So Juan's virtue ebb'd, I know not how;
And first he wonder'd why he had refused;
  And then, if matters could be made up now;
And next his savage virtue he accused,
  Just as a friar may accuse his vow,
Or as a dame repents her of her oath,
Which mostly ends in some small breach of both.

So he began to stammer some excuses;
  But words are not enough in such a matter,
Although you borrow'd all that e'er the muses
  Have sung, or even a Dandy's dandiest chatter,
Or all the figures Castlereagh abuses;
  Just as a languid smile began to flatter
His peace was making, but before he ventured
Further, old Baba rather briskly enter'd.

'Bride of the Sun! and Sister of the Moon!'
