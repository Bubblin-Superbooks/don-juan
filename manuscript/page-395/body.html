In writing 'Courser' by mistake for 'Courier:'
I wish the case could come before a jury here.

But to resume,â€”should there be (what may not
  Be in these days?) some infidels, who don't,
Because they can't find out the very spot
  Of that same Babel, or because they won't

  And written lately two memoirs upon't),
Believe the Jews, those unbelievers, who
Must be believed, though they believe not you,

Yet let them think that Horace has exprest
  Shortly and sweetly the masonic folly
Of those, forgetting the great place of rest,
  Who give themselves to architecture wholly;
We know where things and men must end at best:
