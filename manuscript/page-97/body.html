<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">They are unworthy of my father's daughter;
My mother dream'd not in my natal hour
That I should fall into a monster's power.

'Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,
  You saw that she was sleeping by my side
When you broke in upon us with your fellows:
  Look where you pleaseâ€”we 've nothing, sir, to hide;
Only another time, I trust, you 'll tell us,
  Or for the sake of decency abide
A moment at the door, that we may be
Drest to receive so much good company.

'And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;
  The little I have said may serve to show
The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er
  The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:
I leave you to your conscience as before,
