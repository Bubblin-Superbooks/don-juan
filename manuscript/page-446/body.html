<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">that—
But women with their hearts on heaven knows what!

And yet a headlong, headstrong, downright she,
  Young, beautiful, and daring—who would risk
A throne, the world, the universe, to be
  Beloved in her own way, and rather whisk
The stars from out the sky, than not be free
  As are the billows when the breeze is brisk—
Though such a she 's a devil (if that there be one),
Yet she would make full many a Manichean.

Thrones, worlds, et cetera, are so oft upset
  By commonest ambition, that when passion
O'erthrows the same, we readily forget,
  Or at the least forgive, the loving rash one.
If Antony be well remember'd yet,
  'Tis not his conquests keep his name in</pre></div> </div>
