<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Hail! Thamis, Hail! Upon thy verge it is
That Juan's chariot, rolling like a drum
  In thunder, holds the way it can't well miss,
Through Kennington and all the other 'tons,'
Which makes us wish ourselves in town at once;—

Through Groves, so call'd as being void of trees
  (Like lucus from no light); through prospects named
Mount Pleasant, as containing nought to please,
  Nor much to climb; through little boxes framed
Of bricks, to let the dust in at your ease,
  With 'To be let' upon their doors proclaim'd;
Through 'Rows' most modestly call'd 'Paradise,'
Which Eve might quit without much sacrifice;—

Through coaches, drays, choked turnpikes, and a whirl
  Of wheels, and roar of voices, and confusion;
Here taverns wooing to a pint of 'purl,'
</pre></div> </div>
