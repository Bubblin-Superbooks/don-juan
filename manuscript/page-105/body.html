'Had it but been for a stout cavalier
  Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)—
But for a child, what piece of work is here!

  There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,
And if we can but till the morning keep
Our counsel—(Juan, mind, you must not sleep).'

  Closed the oration of the trusty maid:
She loiter'd, and he told her to be gone,
  An order somewhat sullenly obey'd;
However, present remedy was none,
