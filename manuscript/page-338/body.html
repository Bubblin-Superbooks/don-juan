Hers was a phrensy which disdain'd to rave,
Even when they smote her, in the hope to save.

Yet she betray'd at times a gleam of sense;

Food she refused, and raiment; no pretence
  Avail'd for either; neither change of place,
Nor time, nor skill, nor remedy, could give her
Senses to sleep—the power seem'd gone for ever.

  Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show
A parting pang, the spirit from her past:
  And they who watch'd her nearest could not know
The very instant, till the change that cast
