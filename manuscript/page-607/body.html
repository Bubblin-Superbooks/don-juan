Those houris, like all other pretty creatures,
Do just whate'er they please, by dint of features.

And what they pleased to do with the young khan
  In heaven I know not, nor pretend to guess;
But doubtless they prefer a fine young man
  To tough old heroes, and can do no less;
And that 's the cause no doubt why, if we scan
  A field of battle's ghastly wilderness,
For one rough, weather-beaten, veteran body,
You 'll find ten thousand handsome coxcombs bloody.

Your houris also have a natural pleasure
  In lopping off your lately married men,
Before the bridal hours have danced their measure
  And the sad, second moon grows dim again,
Or dull repentance hath had dreary leisure
