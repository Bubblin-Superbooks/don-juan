Was a small present made to him at Cadiz,
By general subscription of the ladies.

Of poor Pedrillo something still remain'd,
  But was used sparingly,â€”some were afraid,
And others still their appetites constrain'd,
  Or but at times a little supper made;
All except Juan, who throughout abstain'd,
  Chewing a piece of bamboo and some lead:
At length they caught two boobies and a noddy,
And then they left off eating the dead body.

And if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,
  Remember Ugolino condescends
To eat the head of his arch-enemy
  The moment after he politely ends
His tale: if foes be food in hell, at sea
