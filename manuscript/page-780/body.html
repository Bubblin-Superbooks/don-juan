Like many people everybody knows,
  Don Juan was delighted to secure
A goodly guardian for his infant charge,
Who might not profit much by being at large.

Besides, he had found out he was no tutor
  (I wish that others would find out the same);
And rather wish'd in such things to stand neuter,
  For silly wards will bring their guardians blame:
So when he saw each ancient dame a suitor
  To make his little wild Asiatic tame,
Consulting 'the Society for Vice
Suppression,' Lady Pinchbeck was his choice.

Olden she was—but had been very young;
  Virtuous she was—and had been, I believe;
Although the world has such an evil tongue
