Gulbeyaz show'd them both commiseration,
  Or got rid of the parties altogether,
Like other angry ladies of her nation,â€”
  Are things the turning of a hair or feather
May settle; but far be 't from me to anticipate
In what way feminine caprice may dissipate.

I leave them for the present with good wishes,
  Though doubts of their well doing, to arrange
Another part of history; for the dishes
  Of this our banquet we must sometimes change;
And trusting Juan may escape the fishes,
  Although his situation now seems strange
And scarce secure, as such digressions are fair,
The Muse will take a little touch at warfare.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
