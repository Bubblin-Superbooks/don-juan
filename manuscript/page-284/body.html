In Germany, the Pegasus he 'd prance on
  Would be old Goethe's (see what says De Stael);
In Italy he 'd ape the 'Trecentisti;'
In Greece, he sing some sort of hymn like this t' ye:

                THE ISLES OF GREECE.

      The isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!
        Where burning Sappho loved and sung,
      Where grew the arts of war and peace,
        Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!
      Eternal summer gilds them yet,
      But all, except their sun, is set.

      The Scian and the Teian muse,
        The hero's harp, the lover's lute,
      Have found the fame your shores refuse;
