And which in ravage the more loathsome evil isâ€”
Their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?

This is the patent-age of new inventions
  For killing bodies, and for saving souls,
All propagated with the best intentions;
  Sir Humphry Davy's lantern, by which coals
Are safely mined for in the mode he mentions,
  Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,
Are ways to benefit mankind, as true,
Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.

  And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;
'T is pity though, in this sublime world, that
  Pleasure 's a sin, and sometimes sin 's a pleasure;
Few mortals know what end they would be at,
