<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Some sucking hero is compell'd to rear,
Who, when we come to sum up the totality
  Of deeds to human happiness most dear,
Turns out to be a butcher in great business,
Afflicting young folks with a sort of dizziness.

  Are things immortal to immortal man,
As purple to the Babylonian harlot:
  An uniform to boys is like a fan
To women; there is scarce a crimson varlet
  But deems himself the first in Glory's van.
But Glory's glory; and if you would find
What that isâ€”ask the pig who sees the wind!

At least he feels it, and some say he sees,
  Because he runs before it like a pig;
Or, if that simple sentence should displease,
