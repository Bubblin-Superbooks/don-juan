Or said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes,
  I should but bring disgrace upon the dyer,
So supernatural was her passion's rise;
  For ne'er till now she knew a check'd desire:
Even ye who know what a check'd woman is
(Enough, God knows!) would much fall short of this.

Her rage was but a minute's, and 't was wellâ€”
  A moment's more had slain her; but the while
It lasted 't was like a short glimpse of hell:
  Nought 's more sublime than energetic bile,
Though horrible to see yet grand to tell,
  Like ocean warring 'gainst a rocky isle;
And the deep passions flashing through her form
Made her a beautiful embodied storm.

A vulgar tempest 't were to a typhoon
