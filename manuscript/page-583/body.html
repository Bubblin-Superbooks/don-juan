<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">When they built up unto his darling trees,â€”
He moved some hundred miles off, for a station
  Where there were fewer houses and more ease;
The inconvenience of civilisation
  Is, that you neither can be pleased nor please;
But where he met the individual man,
He show'd himself as kind as mortal can.

He was not all alone: around him grew
  A sylvan tribe of children of the chase,
Whose young, unwaken'd world was ever new,
  Nor sword nor sorrow yet had left a trace
On her unwrinkled brow, nor could you view
  A frown on Nature's or on human face;
The free-born forest found and kept them free,
And fresh as is a torrent or a tree.

And tall, and strong, and swift of foot were they,
