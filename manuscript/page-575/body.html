Will oftentimes make deadly quarrels burst
  Out between friends as well as allied nations:
The Briton must be bold who really durst
  Put to such trial John Bull's partial patience,
As say that Wellington at Waterloo
Was beaten—though the Prussians say so too;—

And that if Blucher, Bulow, Gneisenau,
  And God knows who besides in 'au' and 'ow,'
Had not come up in time to cast an awe
  Into the hearts of those who fought till now
As tigers combat with an empty craw,
  The Duke of Wellington had ceased to show
His orders, also to receive his pensions,
Which are the heaviest that our history mentions.

But never mind;—'God save the king!' and kings!
