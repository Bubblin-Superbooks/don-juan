And then dismiss'd the omen from her breast,
  Defying augury with that fond kiss;
And no doubt of all methods 't is the best:

And if I had to give a casting voice,
  For both sides I could many reasons show,
And then decide, without great wrong to either,
It were much better to have both than neither.
