<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">His vice—for he was of a kindling nation—
Is more than I shall venture to describe,
Unless some beauty with a kiss should bribe.

I leave the thing a problem, like all things.
  The morning came, and breakfast, tea and toast,
Of which most men partake, but no one sings.
  The company, whose birth, wealth, worth have cost
My trembling lyre already several strings,
  Assembled with our hostess and mine host.
 The guests dropped in, the last but one, Her Grace,
The latest, Juan with his virgin face.

Which best is to encounter, ghost or none,
  'Twere difficult to say, but Juan looked
As if he had combated with more than one,
  Being wan and worn, with eyes that hardly brooked
The light that through the Gothic windows shone.
