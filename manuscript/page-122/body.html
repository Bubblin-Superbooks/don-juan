With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,
  And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:
Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor
Commit—flirtation with the muse of Moore.

Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,
  His Pegasus, nor anything that 's his;
Thou shalt not bear false witness like 'the Blues'
  (There 's one, at least, is very fond of this);
Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:
  This is true criticism, and you may kiss—
Exactly as you please, or not,—the rod;

If any person should presume to assert
  This story is not moral, first, I pray,
That they will not cry out before they 're hurt,
  Then that they 'll read it o'er again, and</pre></div> </div>
