<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Perhaps the weakness of a heart not void
Of feeling for some kindness done, when power
Had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour.

But I 'm digressing; what on earth has Nero,
  Or any such like sovereign buffoons,
To do with the transactions of my hero,
  More than such madmen's fellow man—the moon's?
Sure my invention must be down at zero,
  And I grown one of many 'wooden spoons'
Of verse (the name with which we Cantabs please
To dub the last of honours in degrees).

I feel this tediousness will never do—
  'T is being too epic, and I must cut down
(In copying) this long canto into two;
  They 'll never find it out, unless I own
The fact, excepting some experienced few;
