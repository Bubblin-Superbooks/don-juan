By borrowing a new one from an ox.

Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;
  And galvanism has set some corpses grinning,
But has not answer'd like the apparatus
  Of the Humane Society's beginning
By which men are unsuffocated gratis:
  What wondrous new machines have late been spinning!
I said the small-pox has gone out of late;
Perhaps it may be follow'd by the great.

'T is said the great came from America;
  Perhaps it may set out on its return,â€”
The population there so spreads, they say
  'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,
With war, or plague, or famine, any way,
