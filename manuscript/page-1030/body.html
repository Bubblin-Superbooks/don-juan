The ghost stopped, menaced, then retired, until
He reached the ancient wall, then stood stone still.

Juan put forth one arm. Eternal powers!
  It touched no soul nor body, but the wall,
On which the moonbeams fell in silvery showers
  Checkered with all the tracery of the hall.
He shuddered, as no doubt the bravest cowers
  When he can't tell what 'tis that doth appal.
How odd, a single hobgoblin's nonentity
Should cause more fear than a whole host's identity.

But still the shade remained, the blue eyes glared,
  And rather variably for stony death.
Yet one thing rather good the grave had spared;
  The ghost had a remarkably sweet breath.
A straggling curl showed he had been fair-haired.
